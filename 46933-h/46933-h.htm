<h2 class="p4">NOTE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p class="pn2">Since the publication of the first edition of
this book two or three readers have pointed
out that it needs an index. By the addition
of an index, they say, its value as a work of
reference would become almost wholly negligible.
Impressed by the force of their remarks,
I employed expert aid, and the index now
printed at the end of the volume is the result.
It was prepared by Miss Narcissa Bloom, an
honor graduate of the Philander Library School,
and it may therefore be relied upon as the
flower of modern library science.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE INTEREST GAUGE</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2 large">THE INTEREST GAUGE</p>

<p class="pn2">"We are thinking of calling them 'interest
gauges,'" said the agent, "but perhaps
you can suggest a better name."</p>

<p>I took one of the little instruments and
examined it. Hardly over an inch long,
with its glass tube and scale, it resembled
a tiny thermometer. The figures and
letters were so small that I could not
make them out, though they became clear
enough through a reading-glass.</p>

<p>"Interest gauges," I remarked, "sounds
like something connected with banks. I
should think you could find a better name.
Who invented them?"</p>

<p>The agent looked important.</p>

<p>"They were invented," he explained,
"by Professor Dufunnie, the great psychologist.
They are a practical application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of psychology. Let me show you how they
are used. Allow me&mdash;I will take this book&mdash;the
'Letters of Junius,' and attach the
interest gauge. Here in the back, you see,
the gauge is invisible to the reader. You
will notice now, if you look through the
glass, that the gauge marks zero. No one
is reading the book, we have not even
opened it, and the human mind is not acting
upon the book. If you will take it into
your hand, and look down at the gauge
through the glass, you will see probably
some little agitation of the liquid within
the tube. You do, do you not? I thought
so. That is because you are probably already
familiar, to some extent, with the
'Letters of Junius' and the recollections
that they arouse in your mind are exerting
themselves upon the fluid. Now, if you
will oblige me, open the book and read attentively
for a few moments."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>I did so, and then handed it back to the
agent.</p>

<p>"Look," he cried, "as soon as you cease
reading, the fluid sinks back to zero. But
the little aluminum arrow remains at the
highest point which the fluid reached&mdash;that
is, the highest point of interest
which you felt in the book. Ah, yes&mdash;40
degrees&mdash;a faint interest. You will
notice that the degree-points are marked
at intervals with descriptive phrases&mdash;40
is 'faint interest,' 30 is 'indifference,' 20 is
'would not keep you awake after 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,'
and so on."</p>

<p>The thing was very fascinating.</p>

<p>"It is astounding," I said, "for that is
exactly my feeling towards Junius, and yet
I tried to get more interested in him than
usual."</p>

<p>The agent laughed.</p>

<p>"You can't fool the gauges," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
"You can't do it, even when you know one
is attached to your book. I need not say
that it is absolutely correct when the reader
is not aware that there is a gauge upon his
book. You must see the value of these to a
librarian. Let me show you how incorruptible
they are. Have you something
there in which you have absolutely no interest&mdash;some
book or article that is dry as
dust?"</p>

<p>I looked about.</p>

<p>"This pretty nearly fills the bill," I
said, and I handed him a copy of a library
magazine with an article by Dr. Oscar
Gustafsen on "How to Make the Workingman
Read the Greek Tragedies."</p>

<p>The agent attached an interest gauge,
and told me to read Dr. Gustafsen's article,
and to try as hard as I could to become interested;
to pretend, if I could not feel, the
greatest excitement over it. I did so, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
strained every muscle in my brain, so to
speak, to find something in it to interest or
attract me. It was no use&mdash;the fluid gave
a few convulsive wabbles, but at the end
the little arrow had not even reached 10, or
"Bored to Death."</p>

<p>Then the agent took a copy of "The
Doctor's Dilemma," and putting an interest
gauge on the volume, asked me to read a
few pages, and to remain as indifferent as
possible. I read it calmly enough, but the
liquid in the tube mounted slow and sure,
and when we examined the arrow it
pointed to 80.</p>

<p>"Try it on this," said the agent, handing
me Conan Doyle's "Round the Fire
Stories."</p>

<p>I put on an interest gauge and read the
tale of "The Lost Special." The arrow shot
up to 98 before I had half finished the yarn.</p>

<p>"The highest that the gauge will record,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
you see, is 140, though we guarantee them
to stand a pressure of 165. They are not
often subjected to anything like that. The
average novel or short story to-day does
not put them under a very severe strain.
The greatest risk we run is from authors
reading their own books. We had an especially
dangerous case the other day, during
some tests in the laboratory. We had
a young author reading the proofs of his
first book, and we put on a high pressure
scale, capable of recording up to 210, and
even then we took off the gauge only just
in time. It had reached the limit, and there
were danger signs."</p>

<p>"What are danger signs?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The liquid begins to boil," he said,
"and then you have to look out for trouble.
Now how many of these will you take? I
can let you have a trial dozen for $4, or
two dozen for $7.50. Two dozen? Thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
you. You attach them in the back of the
book&mdash;so fashion&mdash;or if the book is
bound with a loose back, then you put them
down here. There is no danger of their
being seen, in either case. Here is our
card, we shall be very pleased to fill
any further orders. Thank you. Good
day!"</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone I left my office,
and went out into the public part of the
library. I had started for the reading-room,
when I heard my name called. It
was Professor Frugles, the well-known scientific
historian. He is giving his course of
lectures on "The Constitutional Development
of Schleswig-Holstein" and I had
attended one or two of them. They had
already been going on for two months&mdash;and
although he lectured four times a week,
he hadn't progressed beyond the introduction
and preliminaries. Both of the lectures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I had heard were long wrangles in
which the professor devoted his energies
to proving that some writer on this subject
(a German whose name I did not catch)
was wholly untrustworthy. I was told by
some of the most patient listeners that so
far no single thing about Schleswig-Holstein
itself had been mentioned, and that it
did not appear to be in sight. The course
consisted merely of Frugles' opinions of
the authorities.</p>

<p>Now the professor came slowly toward
me, wiping his face with a large red handkerchief
and waving his cane.</p>

<p>"Got any new books?" he shouted.</p>

<p>I told him we had a few, and took him
back into one of the workrooms. He
examined them.</p>

<p>"This will do; I'll look this over," and
he picked up something in German.</p>

<p>I offered him another&mdash;in English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and, as I thought, rather interesting in
appearance.</p>

<p>"Pah!" he ejaculated, as if I had
put some nauseous thing under his nose,
"popular!"</p>

<p>He exploded this last word, which was
his most violent term of condemnation, and
ran through the rest of the books.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take this into the reading-room
and look it through," and he started
with the German book.</p>

<p>I prevailed upon him to take the other as
well, and he consented, with a grunt. He
did not notice that I had slipped an interest
gauge into both of them.</p>

<p>After a bit, I followed him into the reading-room.
He was in a far corner, hard
at work. Mrs. Cornelia Crumpet was engaged
in conversation with Miss Bixby, the
reference librarian, when I came in.</p>

<p>"Oh, here's Mr. Edwards!" she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
"Why, what a library you have!
I can't find anything at all about the Flemish
Renaissance and I do not know what I
shall do, for I have to read a paper on it to-morrow
afternoon before the Twenty-Minute
Culture Club. Miss Bixby was
just saying she would get me something.
Now what would you advise? There
is nothing at all in the books I looked
at."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you looked in the wrong
books," I suggested, observing that she
had a copy of "Thelma" under her
arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Edwards, how ridiculous of
you! I'm carrying this book home for the
housemaid; she's sick in bed, and the cook
said she was homesick and threatened to
leave. So I said I would get her something
to read to occupy her mind. This is fearful
trash, I suppose, but I thought it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
keep her contented until she got well. But
I do wish you would tell me what to consult
about the Flemish Renaissance."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Crumpet," I said, "Miss Bixby
knows more about that subject in one
minute than I do all day, and I advise you
to let her prescribe."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crumpet agreed to wait, while Miss
Bixby went for the books.</p>

<p>"Where's that copy of 'Thelma'? I
put it down here. Oh, you have it, Mr.
Edwards! Well, you had better let me
take it; I'm sure it is too frivolous for you
serious-minded librarians to read. I'll sit
here and look it over until she comes back
with those books."</p>

<p>She took it, interest gauge and all, and
sat down.</p>

<p>Miss Larkin came into the room just
then and asked me to come over to the
children's department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to show you," she said, "what
an interest these children take in serious
reading and non-fiction. It is most encouraging."</p>

<p>When we arrived at the children's
room she had two or three small persons
arranged about the desks.</p>

<p>"Now, Willie," she said, "which do you
like best, story-books or nature books?"</p>

<p>Willie answered with great promptness:
"Nacher books."</p>

<p>The others all confessed to an extraordinary
fondness for "hist'ry" or "biography"
or "nacher."</p>

<p>I asked Miss Larkin's leave to try a little
experiment, and then explained to her the
workings of the interest gauges. We chose
Willie as a subject for our investigations,
and gave him a copy of one of his beloved
"nacher" books, with a gauge attached.
Five minutes' reading by Willie sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
arrow up to 30, but the same time on "The
Crimson Sweater" sent it up to 110.</p>

<p>"He seems to like Mr. Barbour better
than the Rev. Dr. Fakir, Miss Larkin&mdash;I'm
afraid that his enthusiasm for 'nacher'
is in accordance with what he knows
will please you. Why don't you use your
influence with him to lead him toward
truthfulness? It's a better quality, even,
than a fondness for non-fiction."</p>

<p>As I went back I met Professor Frugles.</p>

<p>"Let me have this, as soon as it is
ready to go out," he said, brandishing the
German work; "this other&mdash;trifling, sir,
trifling!"</p>

<p>And away he went.</p>

<p>But I noticed that the German book had
only sent the gauge up to forty, while the
"trifling" work, which had caused him to
express so much contempt, had registered
seventy-five.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>At the issue desk was Mrs. Crumpet,
having her books charged. As there were
no gauges on the books about the Flemish
Renaissance, I had no data to go on, except
the fact that although she declared she
had "skimmed through" them all and
found them "very helpful," she had not,
so far, cut any of the pages. I did not
mention this to her, as she might have retorted
that we ought to have cut them ourselves.
Which was quite true.</p>

<p>But while she talked with Miss Carey, I
managed to extract the gauge from "Thelma."
At least, I took away the fragments
of it. The arrow had gone up to 140, and
trying to get still higher the little glass tube
had been smashed to bits.</p>

<p class="pc2 large">THE GARDNER'S GUIDE</p>

<p class="pn2">I was looking over the proof sheets for
some Library of Congress catalogue cards
when I observed the name of Bunkum&mdash;Mrs.
Martha Matilda Bunkum was the
full name, and I was further privileged
to learn that she was born in 1851. Everyone
knows Mrs. Bunkum's two great
works: "Handy Hints for Hillside Gardens,"
and "Care and Cultivation of
Crocuses." Now, it seemed, she had accumulated
all her horticultural wisdom into
one book, which was called "The Gardener's
Guide, or a Vade Mecum of Useful
Information for Amateur Gardeners, by
Martha Matilda Bunkum." The Library
of Congress card went on to say that the
book was published in New York, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
well-known firm of Ponsonby, Perks &amp; Co.,
in the year 1911. It brought tears to my
eyes, recalling the days when I, too, was
a cataloguer, to see that the book had "xiv,
7, xv, 27, 316 p., illus., plates.", and moreover
was 19 centimeters high.</p>

<p>As soon as I had recovered from my
emotion, I pressed the electric bell three
times&mdash;a signal that brings Miss Anderson,
the head of the order department, into
my office, unless she happens to be arranging
her hair before the mirror in the stack-room
at the moment. This time she came
promptly.</p>

<p>"Miss Anderson," I said, "we must get
a copy of Mrs. Bunkum's 'Gardener's
Guide.'"</p>

<p>She instantly looked intelligent and replied,
"We have one here now, on approval;
it came in from Malkan this
morning," and she hurried out to get it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>When I had the book, I regarded it
lovingly.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what the 'A. L. A.
Book List' says about this," I pondered.</p>

<p>"It will be along in a couple of months,"
said Miss Anderson, "and then we can
find out."</p>

<p>I told Miss Anderson to keep the book,
anyhow, and to have this copy charged
to my private account.</p>

<p>That night, on the way home, I expended
$1.65 for flower seeds. They were
all put up in attractive little envelopes, with
the most gorgeous pictures on the front,
representing blossoms of tropical splendor.
On the backs was a great deal of information,
as well as Latin names, confident prediction
of what a dazzling mass of bloom
the little packets would bring forth, and
warnings "not to plant these seeds deeper
than one-sixteenth of an inch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>All but the sunflowers. I could not get
any sunflower seeds in packets, and finally
had to get them in a paper bag&mdash;an enormous
lot of them, for five cents. But there
were no pictures, and no directions about
depth. All this, I reflected, would be forthcoming
from the pages of Mrs. Bunkum.</p>

<p>On the following evening, in company
with Jane, I went forth to sow. Jane had
the "Gardener's Guide" and I took certain
tools and implements. By the time I
had a trench excavated a little shower
came up, and Jane retreated to the veranda.
I had on old clothes and didn't
mind.</p>

<p>"Jane!" I called, "look up Mrs. Bunkum
and see how deep to plant sunflower
seeds."</p>

<p>All the directions on the little packets
were so precise about depths&mdash;some seeds
an inch, some half an inch, and some (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
poppies, for instance) only a sixteenth of
an inch below the surface&mdash;that I was
tremendously impressed with the importance
of it all. Previously, I had thought
you just stuck seeds in any old way.</p>

<p>But the rain was coming down harder
now, and my spectacles were getting
blurred. Jane seemed to be lost in admiration
of the frontispiece to the "Gardener's
Guide."</p>

<p>She began to turn the leaves of the
index rapidly, and I could hear her mutter:
"Q, R, S&mdash;here it is. Scrap-book,
screens, slugs, sowing, spider on box. Oh,
I hate spiders! Sunbonnet, sun-dial,
sweet peas. Why, there isn't anything
about sunflowers!"</p>

<p>This annoyed me very much.</p>

<p>"Jane," I said, "how perfectly absurd!
Do you suppose an authority like Mrs.
Bunkum would write a book on gardening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and not mention such common things as
sunflowers? Look again."</p>

<p>She did so, but presently shouted back:
"Well, I don't care! It goes right from
sun-dial to sweet peas, and then Sweet
William, and then to the T's&mdash;Tigrinum
and Tobacco Water. I don't see what this
'Sunbonnet' means, do you? Perhaps
it's a misprint for sunflower. I'll look it
up&mdash;page 199."</p>

<p>Presently Jane found the reference she
was hunting, and read it to me, leaning
out over the rail of the veranda.</p>

<p>"Unless a woman possesses a skin impervious
to wind and sun, she is apt to
come through the summer looking as red
and brown as an Indian; and if one is
often out in the glare, about the only headgear
that can be worn to prevent this,
is the old-fashioned sunbonnet. With its
poke before and cape behind, protecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the neck, one really cannot become sunburned,
and pink ones are not so bad. Retired
behind its friendly shelter, you are
somewhat deaf to the world; and at the
distant house, people may shout to you
and bells be rung at you, and, if your occupation
be engrossing, the excuse 'no one
can hear through a sunbonnet' must be
accepted."</p>

<p>Jane read this with the liveliest interest,
and at its conclusion remarked: "I believe
I'll get a blue one, in spite of her!"</p>

<p>I sneezed two or three times at this
point, and asked her to try again for sunflowers.</p>

<p>"Look here," I suggested, "I've noticed
that index. Perhaps sunflowers are
entered under their class as hardy annuals,
or biennials, or periodicals, or whatever
they are. Look 'em up that way."</p>

<p>She did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing under 'Hardy annuals,'"
she announced, "except 'hardy roses';
under 'Biennials' it says 'see also names
of flowers.'"</p>

<p>This made her laugh and say: "Here's
a librarian getting a taste of his own
medicine. No, it gives a reference to page
117. Here it is: 'There are but few
hardy biennials. The important ones,
which no garden should be without, are:
Digitalis, and Campanula Medium.' Why,
I thought Digitalis was something you put
in your eye!"</p>

<p>"Did you look under 'periodicals'?" I
retorted. "I could put something in <i>her</i>
eye! Did you look under 'periodicals'?"</p>

<p>Jane referred again to the index.</p>

<p>"There isn't any such thing," she said
presently; "don't you mean perennials?
Here's a lot about them. Oh, yes, and a
list of them, too. Now, let me see&mdash;Aquilegia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Dianthus barbatus, Dicentra
spectabilis&mdash;gracious! do you suppose
any of those are sunflowers?"</p>

<p>I groaned.</p>

<p>"Would you mind getting me a rain-coat?
I'm afraid these seeds will sprout
in my hand in a few minutes, if we don't
get some information soon."</p>

<p>Jane went into the house, but returned
in about five minutes with an umbrella.</p>

<p>"Your rain-coat isn't here," she said,
"you left it at the library that day that
it cleared during the afternoon. I will
send Amanda out with this umbrella."</p>

<p>"Do so by all means," I replied, "as I
have only two hands occupied with the
trowel and the sunflower seeds it will be
a pleasure to balance an umbrella as well."</p>

<p>But Jane did not notice the sarcasm,
and presently Amanda tiptoed out through
the wet grass with the umbrella. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
left trying to hold it, and wondering
how Mrs. Bunkum acted in a crisis like
this. But of course she never got caught
in one. She would know right off the bat
just how deep to put the seeds. At any
rate, Jane's researches among the Aquilegias
had given me an idea.</p>

<p>"Look here," I called, "Mrs. Bunkum
is so confounded classical or scientific, or
whatever it is, that I believe she scorns to
use such a vulgar word as sunflower.
She's probably put it under its scientific
name."</p>

<p>Jane looked as though the last difficulty
had been removed.</p>

<p>"What would the scientific name be?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"I am trying to think, as well as I can,
standing in this puddle." I was sparring
for time. "It would be <i>helio</i> something, I
suppose," I added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heliotrope, of course!" exclaimed
Jane, with a glad chortle. "Here they
are; all about them!"</p>

<p>"No! no! no!" I shouted, "I do wish
you wouldn't jump at conclusions so.
Heliotrope means a flower that turns
around to follow the sun."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I thought sunflowers
did that."</p>

<p>"So they do," I told her, "but heliotropes
are little blue things, as you very
well know&mdash;or ought to. Now, you go
to the telephone, and call up the library,
and ask for Miss Fairfax. She is in the
reference room now, or ought to be."</p>

<p>There was a pause, while I could hear
Jane at the telephone.</p>

<p>"North, double six three, please. No,
double six three. Yes. Hello! Hello!
Is this the library? Yes, the library.
Yes; is Miss Fairfax there? Ask her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
come to the 'phone, please. I said, ask
her to come to the 'phone. Is that
Miss Fairfax? Oh, Miss Fairfax, this
is Mrs. Edwards. Mr. Edwards wants
you to go as quickly as possible to
the reference room and look up the scientific
name for sunflowers. He says, look
it up in Bailey. Do you understand?
What? What? No, I said the scientific
name for sunflowers, you know, s-u-n-f-l-o-w-e-r-s.
The tall things with yellow
petals and brown centers. <i>Sunflowers!!!</i>
What? Who is this talking? Is this Miss
Fairfax? What, isn't this the Public
Library? What? Well, where is it, then?
Henderson's glue factory? Oh, pardon
me! I thought it was the Public Library.
Central gave me the wrong number....
Hello, is this central? Well, you gave me
the wrong number; you gave me North
double six two. I want North double six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
three&mdash;the Public Library. Yes, please.
Hello, is this the Public Library? Yes;
who is this speaking, please? Oh, Miss
Anderson? Is that you? This is Mrs.
Edwards, yes. What are you staying so
late for? You are? Well, I shall speak
to Mr. Edwards about it. It is perfectly
ridiculous to have you working overtime
night after night, and all for that foolish
exhibition, too. I know these librarians; if
they would have the courage not to try to
do so much when the city is so stingy about
giving them assistants! Well, you go
right home now and get your dinner. The
idea! What? You have accessioned two
hundred books this afternoon? If Mr.
Edwards doesn't stop that, I shall, that's
all. Oh, you have saved me out a copy of
'The Chaperone.' How nice of you! No,
I certainly do not. I didn't like 'Cora
Kirby' very much, and 'The Players' was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
horrid! But I did want to see what this
was like&mdash;it has been very favorably criticised.
What? Oh, give it to Mr. Edwards
to-morrow night, put it in his bag, at the
bottom; he'll never notice it. I hope there
are not any more of you there! Oh,
Miss Tyler and Miss Hancock, out at the
desk, of course, and who? Miss Fairfax?
Dear me, that reminds me. Mr. Edwards
wants Miss Fairfax to look up something
for him. Goodness, I forgot all about it!
He is standing out there in all this rain
with an umbrella in one hand, a trowel in
the other, and a package of sunflower seeds
in the other. He'll be furious! Do go
and get Miss Fairfax to come to the
'phone right away. Yes, to come to the
'phone.... What's that? Is that central?
No, please hold the line; I haven't
finished yet.... Is that you, Miss Fairfax?
What? Oh, Miss Anderson? What?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Miss Fairfax has gone to her supper?
What on earth shall I do? Who is in
the reference room? David? Who's
he? Oh, that new page.... David,
Mr. Edwards wants you to look up the
scientific name for sunflowers; look it up
in Bailey, David. What? Bailey who? I
don't know. Ask some of them there....
Oh, well, wait a minute. Hold the line....</p>

<p>"Sam!" And she came out to the
veranda again. "Sam, what Bailey is it
they are to look it up in?"</p>

<p>"Liberty Hyde," I yelled. "Cyclopædia
of American Horticulture! But
any dictionary will probably do. And, for
the love of Mike, get a move on! I'm
drowned, paralyzed! I'll have rheumatism
for a week!"</p>

<p>But she was already back at the telephone.</p>

<p>"David, are you there? Mr. Edwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
says it's Liberty Hyde Bailey's Cyclopædia
of Horticulture. And you are to
hurry, hurry! What is that? You don't
know where it is? Well, look it up in the
catalogue.... Oh, ask Miss Anderson
to come back.... Is that you, Miss Anderson?
Will you look it up, please?
Yes, the scientific name for sunflowers.
In Freedom Bailey's Cyclopædia of Agriculture,
or any dictionary.... Did you
find it? Yes? What? Spell it. Oh,
<i>Helianthus</i>. Thank you so much! Good-by!
And don't forget to send 'The
Chaperone' home by Mr. Edwards to-morrow
night. Thank you for keeping me
a copy. Good-by...."</p>

<p>She came back to the veranda.</p>

<p>"I've got it at last, Sam. It's <i>Helianthus</i>.
Where's Mrs. Bunkum? Oh, I left
her in the study. Just wait a minute, now....
Yes, here it is, Helianthus, sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
enough. How silly! Why doesn't she call
'em sunflowers? There, page 189. This
is what Mrs. Bunkum says: 'The Helianthus
Grandiflora, or common sunflower, is
one of the most attractive and satisfactory
of the perennials. Nothing is so suitable
to place against a wall, or to employ to
cover a shed or any other unattractive
feature of the landscape. The stalks grow
sometimes as high as eight to ten feet and
bloom from July to September. It is well
not to plant Delphiniums too near the
Helianthus, as the shade from the former
is too intense and it would not do to risk
spoiling the lovely blossoms of the Delphinium.
The latter ... why!" broke
out Jane, "she goes on about Delphiniums
now, and doesn't tell any more about sunflowers!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," I asked&mdash;and
there was a hard, steely ring in my voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
"do you mean to say that Mrs. Bunkum
does not tell how deep I am to plant these
cussed seeds?"</p>

<p>Jane was about to laugh or to cry&mdash;I
am not sure which.</p>

<p>"Not a word more than what I read,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"Jane," I said solemnly and firmly, "go
into the house. What is going to happen
is not a fit sight for your eyes. Praise be,
that book is mine, and not the library's,
and I can deal with it justly. Give it here.
And if you have any affection for Martha
Matilda Bunkum, kiss her good-by. I do
not know how deep these seeds go, but I
know how deep she goes." And I began
to dig a suitable hole.</p>

<p class="p2">I rejoined my wife at dinner after a
bath and certain life-saving remedies.</p>

<p>"Milton uttered curses on him who destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a good book, but what do you
think will come up in ground fertilized by
Mrs. Bunkum?" I asked.</p>

<p>Jane giggled.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she said, "but if you
erect a tombstone to her, I can suggest an
epitaph."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I questioned.</p>

<p>"The Gardeners Guyed," said Jane.

<p class="pc2 large">VANISHING FAVORITES</p>

<p class="pn2">It is nearly twelve months since anyone
has lamented the disappearance of our old
favorite characters of fiction. While these
expressions of sorrow are undoubtedly
sincere, they are seldom practical. No one,
for instance, has ever suggested any
method for the perpetuation of the heroes
and villains of the old plays and romances.
No one has urged that when the government
subsidizes authors, and pensions
poets, a sum shall be set aside for such
writers as will agree to stick to the old-fashioned
characters. Yet it would prove
effective.</p>

<p>Of its desirability nothing need be said.</p>

<p>It is no answer to those who regret the
passing of their old friends to say that they
can still be found in the old books. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is like sending to a museum to view dried
bones, some person who yearns to behold
the ichthyosaurus splashing among the
waves, or the pterodactyl soaring overhead.
Indeed, the cases are similar for
more than one reason. How greatly would
the joy of life increase if we only had a
few extinct animals left! The African
hunter returns with an assortment of hippopotamuses,
elephants, and jubjub birds.
It would be more delightful if he could
also fetch the mighty glyptodon, the terrible
dinotherium, and the stately bandersnatch.</p>

<p>There are few of the old characters of
fiction more generally missed than the retired
colonel, home from India. He was
usually rather portly in figure, though
sometimes tall and thin. Always his face
was the color of a boiled lobster, and his
white moustache and eyebrows bristled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
furiously. For forty years he had lived
exclusively on curries, chutney, and brandy
and soda, so his liver was not all it
should be.</p>

<p>His temper had not sweetened. He was
what you might call irritable.</p>

<p>During forty years he had been lord
and master over a regiment of soldiers,
and a village of natives, and he had the
habit of command.</p>

<p>His favorite remark was: "Br-r-r-r!!"</p>

<p>That is as near as it can be reproduced
in print, but from the manner in which his
lips rolled when he delivered it, and the
explosive force with which it ended, you
could see that he had learned it from a
Bengal tiger. His was an imposing presence,
but his speaking part was not large.
In fact, his only contributions to social intercourse
were the exclamation which has
been quoted, and one other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>This sounded like "Yah!" but it was
delivered with a rasping snarl which must
be heard to be appreciated. Such was his
manner toward his equals; toward servants
and underlings he was not so agreeable.
On the whole, there was reason to
think that he was somehow related to the
celebrated personage who "eats 'em
alive," or to that other individual called
Gritchfang, who "guzzled hot blood, and
blew up with a bang."</p>

<p>The colonel was a genial and interesting
old "party," and we lament his disappearance.</p>

<p>There was a turtle-dove to coo, however,
in the same stories where the colonel
roared. This was the dying maiden. She
has not altogether left us&mdash;her final
struggles are protracted. Her dissolution
is expected at almost any moment now.</p>

<p>Her specialty was being wan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Come what might, at any hour of the
day or night, under all circumstances, she
was very, very wan. You could never
catch her forgetting it. She reminded you
of Bunthorne's injunction to the twenty
lovesick maidens&mdash;she made you think
of faint lilies.</p>

<p>Usually she lay on a couch in the drawing-room,
but she could, with assistance,
make her way to the window to wave her
handkerchief to Cousin Harry departing
to the war. She was in love with Cousin
Harry, but knew that he cared most for
proud, red-cheeked Sister Gladys. So she
suffered in silence, and when Cousin Harry
forged a few checks, she bought them up,
and arranged a happy marriage between
Harry and Gladys&mdash;who was in love with
someone else.</p>

<p>This was so that she could be a martyr.
She loved being a martyr, and was willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to make everyone else intensely uncomfortable
in order to accomplish her object.
She was very gentle and sweet, and even
the Colonel would cease to bellow and
snort in her presence.</p>

<p>The really learned heroine has gone for
good. She is as rare as the megatherium.
Her successors&mdash;the women who can discuss
a little politics, or who know something
about literature&mdash;are only collateral
descendants. There is some doubt about
even that degree of kinship. They are not
the real things.</p>

<p>Our old friend had stockings of cerulean
blue&mdash;though she would have died
had she shown half an inch of one of them.
Her idea of courtship was to get the hero
in a woodland bower and then say something
like this:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have never realized, Mr.
Montmorency, how profoundly the philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the Rosicrucians has affected
modern thought in its ultimate conception
of ontology. The epistemological sciences
exhibit the effect of Thales' dictum concerning
the fourth state of material
cosmogony."</p>

<p>And Mr. Montmorency liked it, too. He
had a reply all ready. He wondered if it
really was Thales so much as Empedocles
or Ctesias. She showed him that his suspicions
were groundless. Thales was the
man.</p>

<p>He gave up all idea of holding her hand,
and listened to a fifteen-minute discourse
on the Peripatetics.</p>

<p>After this kind of heroine, is it any
wonder that we object to the bridge-playing
ladies with a passion for alcohol, who
are served to us by the novelist of to-day?</p>

<p>The learned heroine of the old books
talked as no one can talk now, except, possibly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a Radcliffe girl with a blue book in
front of her, the clock pointing to a quarter
of twelve, and a realization that a
failure to get B minus in the exam. will
make it impossible for her to secure a
degree in three years.</p>

<p>The saintly children of the old fiction
are perhaps the offspring of the learned
heroine and Mr. Montmorency. Certainly
such a marriage would result in children
of no commonplace type. These, however,
tend not so much to scholarship as to good
behavior. They would get 98 in all their
studies, but 100 plus in deportment.</p>

<p>They are too good to be true. They
have enough piety to fit out a convocation
of bishops, with a great deal left over.
The little girls among them are addicted
to the death-bed habit. Only they carry
the matter further than the invalid heroine.</p>

<p>They actually die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The one thing worth living for, in their
estimation, is to gather a group of weeping
relatives and the minister about their
beds on a beautiful morning in June, and
then pass serenely away, uttering sentiments
of such lofty morality that even the
minister feels abashed. The pet lamb, the
hoop, the golden curls and the pantalettes,
which had been their accessories during
seven years in the mortal vale, are cheerfully
left behind for the joy of this solemn
moment.</p>

<p>There ought to be no dispute over the
statement that one other old-fashioned
fictitious character is badly missed.</p>

<p>This is the family ghost.</p>

<p>The modern substitute for the real
thing is like offering a seat in a trolley
car to someone who has been used to a
sedan chair. The modern ghost is a ready-made
product of a psychological laboratory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and you know that his Bertillon measurements
are filed away in a card-catalogue
somewhere.</p>

<p>The old ghost used to groan and clank
chains, and leave gouts of blood (gouts
always&mdash;never drops) all over the place.</p>

<p>Or, if it were a lady ghost, she sighed
sweetly and slipped out of your bedroom
window to the moonlit balcony.</p>

<p>You could get along with ghosts like
either of them. You knew what they were
up to.</p>

<p>But the ghost of contemporary fiction
is as obscure as Henry James. He is a
kind of disembodied idea; he never
groans, nor clanks chains; and you cannot
be sure whether he is a ghost, or a psychological
suggestion, or a slight attack of
malarial fever. In nothing is the degeneracy
and effeminacy of our literature
more apparent than in its anæmic ghosts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Hashimura Togo says that "when a Negro
janitor sees a ghost, he are a superstition;
but when a college professor sees one, he
are a scientific phenomenon." When that
point has been reached with real ghosts,
what can be expected of the fictitious ones?</p>

<p>Along with the family ghost disappeared
the faithful old family servant. He was
usually a man, and he looked like E. S.
Willard as Cyrus Blenkarn. He dressed
in snuff-colored clothes, and he bent over,
swaying from side to side like a polar-bear
in a cage. He rubbed his hands.
But he was very devoted to the young
mistress.</p>

<p>Lor' bless yer, Sir, he knew her mother,
he did, when she was only that high. Carried
her in his arms when she was a little
babby. But he is afraid something is going
wrong with the old place. He doesn't
like the looks of things, nohow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>With the superhuman instinct granted
to servants, but denied to their superiors,
he has become suspicious of the villain on
sight. It is lucky that no one believes the
old servant, or they would pitch out the
villain then and there, and the story would
come to an end at Chapter II.</p>

<p>The utter chaos into which villains have
fallen has been a cause for regretful comment
for years past. Long ago it was
pointed out that villains no longer employ
direct and honorable methods like murder
and assault. The sum of their criminal
activities is a stock-market operation that
ruins the hero.</p>

<p>Things have gone from bad to worse.</p>

<p>Now you cannot tell which is the villain
and which the hero. The old, simple days
when the villain, as Mr. J. K. Jerome said,
was immediately recognized by the fact
that he smoked a cigarette, have long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
since passed away. Now, the villain and
hero in Chapter I. have usually changed
places two or three times by the end of
the book.</p>

<p>Let no one think that this complaint
is made because we regret losing our admiration
for the hero. We never had
any. He was always such a chuckle-headed
ninny that you longed to throw
rocks at him from the start.</p>

<p>The lamentable thing is to see the villain
falling steadily away from the paths of
vice and crime, and taking up with one
virtuous practice after another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the hero is making feeble
efforts at villainy, which result, of course,
in complete failure. You cannot learn to
be a villain at Chapter XXIV. It is too
late. Villains, like poets, are born, not
made, and in the older books the faithful
servant could tell you that the villain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
bad from the cradle. Hereditary influence
and unremitting attention to business are
as necessary in the villain trade as in any
other.</p>

<p>There is one other phase of the making
of villains which deserves consideration.
That is, their nationality.</p>

<p>Once you had only to know that the man
who appeared at Chapter III., twirling his
moustache and making polite speeches,
was a French count or a Russian prince,
to be sure that on him would fall the responsible
post of chief villain during the
rest of the story.</p>

<p>If the novel were written in America,
an English lord could be added to the list.
The titled foreigner, whatever he might
be, was expected to try to elope with the
heroine, for the sake of her money. The
hero baffled him finally, and seized the
opportunity, at the moment of bafflement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to deliver a few patriotic sentences
on the general superiority of republican
institutions.</p>

<p>This is all changed. We have had novels
and plays with virtuous, even admirable,
English lords. Once or twice members of
the French nobility have appeared in another
capacity than that of advance agent
of wickedness. It is time to call a halt,
or the first thing we know someone will
write a book with a virtuous Russian
prince in it.</p>

<p>The line must be drawn somewhere.
The mission of Russia in English literature
is to furnish tall, smooth, diabolical
persons, devoted to vodka, absinthe, oppression
of the peasantry, cultivation of a
black beard, and general cussedness. We
foresee that the novelists will soon have
to draw upon Japan for their villains.
Much ought to be made of a small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
oily, smiling Oriental, who is nursing
horrid plots beneath a courteous
exterior.</p>

<p>At the time of the first performances of
Mr. Moody's play "The Great Divide," it
was pleasant to see that a sense of fitness
in the nationality of villains had not entirely
died out. It may be remembered
that the first act represents an American
man joining with a Mexican and a nondescript
in an atrocious criminal enterprise.
At least one newspaper had the sturdy patriotism
to call the dramatist to account
for insinuating that an American could
possibly do such a thing.</p>

<p>"Furriners," perhaps, but Americans,
never! Shame on you, Mr. Moody!</p>

<p>While so many of the chief characters
of the old fiction have vanished, there is
a chorus of minor ones who have also
moved away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Where, for instance, is the village
simpleton? He was a useful personage,
for he could be depended upon to make
the necessary heroic sacrifice in the last
chapter but one. When the church steeple
burst into flames, or the dam broke and
the flood descended on the town, or the
secondary villain was tying the heroine's
mother to the railroad track, the hero was
holding the center of the stage and seeing
that the heroine escaped in safety.</p>

<p>But who was that slight figure climbing
aloft in the lurid glare of the burning
belfry, or swimming across the raging torrent,
or running up to the bridge waving
a red lantern? Who, indeed, but poor,
despised Benny Bilkins, the village idiot?
He fell with a crash when the steeple came
down, or disappeared forever in the angry,
swirling waters, or was ground under the
wheels of the locomotive&mdash;but then there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was a grave for the heroine to strew violets
upon, in the last chapter.</p>

<p>The miser, too, has utterly disappeared.
In facial characteristics he resembled the
faithful old family servant, except that he
had deeper lines on his brow. He liked to
get out a table, and sit over it with a bag
of gold.</p>

<p>No banks for him.</p>

<p>He wanted his gold pieces near at hand,
so that he could fetch them out at any
hour, clink them together and gloat over
them.</p>

<p>He was a clinker and a gloater&mdash;he
cared for nothing else.</p>

<p>We do not have any misers now. Or,
if they exist, they go away to a safety
deposit vault, get their bonds and gloat
over them. Half the fun is gone, you see.
You can gloat over bonds as much as you
like, but not a clink can you get out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
them. That probably accounts for the disappearance
of misers.</p>

<p>We earnestly request some novelist to
bring about a resurrection of these characters.
They would be welcome in the
short stories, as well. During the past
fifteen years American fiction has gone
through two epochs&mdash;the Gadzooks school
and the B'Gosh school.</p>

<p>It is now congealed in what may be
called the Ten Below Zero School. Any
constant reader of the magazines has to
keep on his ulster, ear-tabs, mittens and
gum-shoes, from one year's end to another.
It never thaws. Loggers, miners, trappers,
explorers&mdash;any kind of persons so
long as they dwell in the frozen north&mdash;are
what the magazine writer adores.</p>

<p>One of Kipling's characters says that
there's never a law of God or man runs
north of 53. The magazine editors seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to think there's never a thing worth writing
of, lives south of 85. Will not some
of them dig up one or two of the old characters
we have been discussing, and see
if they cannot send the thermometer up a
few degrees?</p>

<p>We are tired of stamping our feet,
blowing on our hands, and rubbing snow
on our noses to keep them from falling off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a><br /><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2 large">BY TELEPHONE</p>

<p class="pn2">"On January 14th," so announced a circular
issued last month by the Ezra Beesly
Free Public Library of Baxter, "we shall
install a telephone service at the library.
Telephone your inquiries to the library, and
they will be answered over the wire."</p>

<p>Now, January 14th was last Saturday,
and this is undoubtedly the first account
of the innovation at Baxter.</p>

<p>Miss Pansy Patterson, assistant reference
librarian, took her seat at the telephone
promptly at nine o'clock, ready to
answer all questions. She had, near her,
a small revolving bookcase containing an
encyclopædia, a dictionary, the Statesman's
Year Book, Who's Who in America,
Mulhall's Dictionary of Statistics,
The Old Librarian's Almanack, the Catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the Boston Athenæum, Baedeker's
guide book to the United States, Cruden's
Concordance, and a few others of the most
valuable reference books, in daily use
among librarians.</p>

<p>Should this stock fail her she could send
the stenographer, Miss Parkinson, on a
hurry call to the reading-room, where Miss
Bixby, the head reference librarian, would
be able to draw on a larger collection of
books to find the necessary information.</p>

<p>Mr. Amos Vanhoff, the new librarian of
Baxter, stood over the telephone, rubbing
his hands in pleasant anticipation of the
workings of the new system which he had
installed.</p>

<p>The bell rang almost immediately, and
Miss Patterson took the receiver from its
hook.</p>

<p>"Is this the library?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is Mrs. Humphrey Mayo. I understand
that you answer inquiries by
telephone? Yes! Thank you. Have you
any books about birds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;a great many. Which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well; I am so much interested in a
large bird that has been perching on a
syringa bush on our front lawn for the
last half hour. It is a very extraordinary-looking
bird&mdash;I have never seen one like
it. I cannot make it out clearly through the
opera glass, and I do not dare to go nearer
than the piazza for fear of startling it. I
only discovered it as I was eating breakfast,
and I do not know how long it has
been there. None of the bird books I own
seem to tell anything about such a bird.
Now, if I should describe it to you do you
think you could look it up in some of your
books?"</p>

<p>"Why, I think so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it's a very large bird&mdash;like an
eagle or a large hawk. And it is nearly
all black; but its feathers are very much
ruffled up. It has a collar or ruff around
its neck, and on its head there is a splash
of bright crimson or scarlet. I think it
must be some tropical bird that has lost
its way. Perhaps it is hurt. Now, what
do you suppose it is?"</p>

<p>"You see, I haven't any bird books
right at hand&mdash;I'll send in to the reading-room.
Will you hold the line, please?"</p>

<p>Miss Patterson turned to the stenographer
and repeated Mrs. Mayo's description
of the strange bird.</p>

<p>"Will you please ask Miss Bixby to
look it up, and let me know as soon as
possible?"</p>

<p>During the interval that followed, the
operator at central asked three times:
"Did you get them?" and three times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Mrs. Mayo and Miss Patterson chanted in
unison: "Yes; hold the line, please!"</p>

<p>Finally the messenger returned, remarking
timidly: "He says it's a crow."</p>

<p>"A crow!" exclaimed Miss Patterson.</p>

<p>"A crow!" echoed Mrs. Mayo, at the
other end of the wire, "oh, that is impossible.
I know <i>crows</i> when I see them.
Why, this has a ruff, and a magnificent red
coloring about its head. Oh, it's no
crow!"</p>

<p>"Whom did you see in there?" inquired
Miss Patterson. "Miss Bixby?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the young and timid
stenographer, "it was that young man&mdash;I
don't know his name."</p>

<p>She had entered the library service only
the week before.</p>

<p>"Oh, Edgar! He doesn't know anything
about anything. Miss Bixby must
have left the room for a moment, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
suppose he had brought in a book for a
reader. He is only a page&mdash;you mustn't
ask him any questions. Do go back and
see if Miss Bixby isn't there now, and
ask her."</p>

<p>A long wait ensued, and as Mrs. Mayo's
next-door neighbor insisted on using the
telephone to order her dinner from the
marketmen, the line had to be abandoned.
In ten or fifteen minutes, however, the assistant
reference librarian was once more
in communication with Mrs. Mayo.</p>

<p>"We think the bird might possibly be
a California grebe&mdash;but we cannot say for
sure. It is either that or else Hawkins's
giant kingfisher&mdash;unless it has a tuft back
of each ear. If it has the tufts, it may be
the white-legged hoopoo. But Mr. Reginald
Kookle is in the library, and we have
asked him about it. You know of Mr.
Kookle, of course?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, the author of 'Winged Warblers
of Waltham' and 'Common or Garden
Birds'?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and of 'Birds I Have Seen Between
Temple Place and Boylston Street'
and 'The Chickadee and His Children.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed&mdash;I know his books very
well. I own several of them. What does
he think?"</p>

<p>"He is not sure. But Miss Bixby described
this bird to him, and he is very
much interested. He has started for your
house already, because he wants to see the
bird."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be perfectly lovely.
Thank you so much. It will be fine to
have Mr. Kookle's opinion. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p class="p2">And the conference was ended. It may
not be out of place to relate that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Kookle, the eminent bird author, arrived
at Mrs. Mayo's a few minutes later.
As he heard that the mysterious stranger
was on the front lawn, he approached
the house carefully from the rear, and
climbed over the back fence. He walked
around the piazza to the front door, where
Mrs. Mayo awaited him.</p>

<p>Mr. Kookle was dressed in his famous
brown suit, worn in order that he might be
in perfect harmony with the color of dead
grass, and hence, as nearly as possible,
unseen on the snowless, winter landscape.
He had his field glasses already leveled
on the syringa bush when Mrs. Mayo
greeted him. She carried an opera glass.</p>

<p>"Right there&mdash;do you see, Mr.
Kookle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see him all right."</p>

<p>They both looked intently at the bird.
The weather was a little unfavorable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
close observation, for, as it may be remembered,
Saturday morning was by turns
foggy and rainy. A light mist hung over
the wet grass now, but the tropical visitor,
or whatever he was, could be descried without
much difficulty.</p>

<p>He sat, or stood, either on the lower
branches of the bush, or amongst them,
on the ground. His feathers were decidedly
ruffled, and he turned his back
toward his observers. His shoulders were
a little drawn up, in the attitude usually
ascribed by artists to Napoleon, looking
out over the ocean from St. Helena's rocky
isle. But it was possible, even at that distance,
to see his magnificent crimson crest.</p>

<p>Mr. Kookle took a deep breath. "Yes,"
he said, "I suspected it."</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Mrs. Mayo, eagerly,
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Madam," returned the bird author, impressively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"you have my sincerest congratulations.
I envy you. You have the
distinction of having been the first observer,
to the best of my knowledge, of
the only specimen of the Bulbus Claristicus
Giganticus ever known to come north of
the fourteenth parallel of latitude."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayo was moved nearly to tears.
Never in all her career as a bird enthusiast,
not even when she addressed the
Twenty Minute Culture Club on "Sparrows
I Have Known"&mdash;never had she
felt the solemn joy that filled her at this
minute.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that is what it is?" she
asked in hushed tones.</p>

<p>"Absolutely positive," replied the authority,
"at least&mdash;if I could only get a
nearer view of his feet, I could speak with
certainty. Now, if we could surround the
bush, so to speak, you creeping up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
one side and I from the other, we might
get nearer to him. I will make a détour to
your driveway, and so get on the other side
of him. You approach him from the
house."</p>

<p>"Just let me get my rubbers," said Mrs.
Mayo.</p>

<p>"Please hurry," the other returned.</p>

<p>When the rubbers were procured they
commenced their strategic movement. "If
I could only be sure that it is the Bulbus!"
ejaculated Mr. Kookle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayo turned toward him.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," she whispered,
"that it is the great condor of the Andes?"</p>

<p>Mr. Kookle shook his head.</p>

<p>Then they both started again on their
stealthy errand. Slowly, quietly, they proceeded
until they stood opposite each other,
with the syringa and its strange visitant
half-way between them. Then Mr. Kookle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
raised his hand as a signal, and they began
to approach the bush. The bird seemed
to hear them, for he immediately took interest
in the proceedings. He raised his
head, hopped out from the bush, and uttered
a peculiar, hoarse note that sounded
like:</p>

<p>"Craw-w-w-w!"</p>

<p>Mr. Kookle and Mrs. Mayo stopped in
their tracks, electrified. Then the bird put
its other foot on the ground and gave vent
to this remarkable song:</p>

<p>"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, ker-dar-cut!
Ker-dar-cut! Ker-dar-cut!"</p>

<p>Then it gave two or three more raucous
squawks, ran toward the fence, flew over
it, ran across the street, under Mr. Higgins's
fence, and joined his other Black
Minorca fowls that were seeking their
breakfast in the side yard.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Mayo returned to the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and Mr. Reginald Kookle, the author of
"Winged Warblers of Waltham" and
"The Chickadee and His Children," returned
his field glasses to their case, turned
up the collar of his famous brown suit, and
walked rapidly down the street.</p>

<p class="p2">But Miss Patterson had been busy at
the library telephone all this time.
Scarcely had she ended her conversation
with Mrs. Mayo when someone called her
to have her repeat "Curfew Shall Not
Ring To-night" over the telephone. This
was only finished when the bell rang again.</p>

<p>"Hello! This the library?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you'd tell me the answer
to this. There's a prize offered in the
'Morning Howl' for the first correct answer.
'I am only half as old as my uncle,'
said a man, 'but if I were twice as old as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is I should only be three years older than
my grandfather, who was born at the age
of sixteen. How old was the man?'
Now, would you let x equal the age of the
uncle, or the man?"</p>

<p>Miss Patterson could not think of any
immediate answer to this, nor of any book
of reference that would tell her instantly.
So she appealed to Mr. Vanhoff, who had
returned to the room.</p>

<p>"What was that?" inquired Mr.
Vanhoff; "get him to repeat it."</p>

<p>She did so, and the librarian struggled
with it for a moment. "Why, it is all nonsense.
Tell him that we cannot solve any
newspaper puzzles over the telephone. He
will have to come to the library."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Pomfret Smith announced
herself on the telephone.</p>

<p>"That the library? Who is this? Miss
Patterson? Oh, how do you do? This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is so nice of Mr. Vanhoff. I was coming
down to the library this morning, but the
weather is so horrid that I thought I
would telephone instead. Now, my cousin
is visiting me, and I have told her about a
novel I read last summer, and she is just
crazy to read it, too. But I can't for the
life of me recall the name of it. Now, do
you remember what it was?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I'm afraid I don't. Who was
the author?"</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble. I can't remember
his name to save my life! I'm
not even sure that I noticed his name&mdash;or
her name&mdash;whoever it was. I never
care much who wrote them&mdash;I just look
them through, and if they're illustrated
by Howard Chandler Christy or anybody
like that, I just take them, because I know
then they'll be all right. This one had
pictures by Christy or Wenzell or one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
those men. It was a lovely book&mdash;oh, I
do wish you could tell me what it was!
Where is Miss Anderson? She would
know. Isn't she there?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I am sorry, she will not be here
till afternoon. If you could tell me something
about the novel&mdash;the plot, and so
forth, I might have read it myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you've read it. Why,
you read all the books that come into the
library, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not quite all."</p>

<p>"You don't? How funny! Why, whatever
do you find to do with yourselves
down there? You're sure you don't remember
the one I want?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Smith, you haven't told
me about the plot of it yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, so I haven't. Well&mdash;let me
see&mdash;Um! why, it was about&mdash;now,
what in the world <i>was</i> it about? Oh dear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
I never can think, with this thing up to
my ear! What's that, Central? Yes, I
got them all right&mdash;hold the line, please.
Oh dear, I'll have to ring off and think
it over, and as soon as I remember, I'll
call you up again. Thank you, so much!
Good-by."</p>

<p>The next was a man who spoke in a deep
voice. "Hello! Is this the library? Have
you a history of Peru? You have? Now,
that is very fortunate. I do not know how
many places I have inquired. I only want
a few facts&mdash;only a paragraph or two.
You can tell them to me over the 'phone,
can you not, and I will take them down?"</p>

<p>Miss Patterson had her finger on an
article about Peru in the encyclopædia.
"'Peru,'" she began to read, "'the ancient
kingdom of the Incas&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Of the whichers?" interrupted the
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Incas," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Spell it," he commanded.</p>

<p>"<em class="gesperrt">Incas</em>," she spelled.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" said the man, "that's
South America. I've been hearing about
them all day. The principal of the High
School gave me a song and dance about
the Incas. I mean Peru, Indiana. Here,
I'll come down to the library&mdash;this telephone
booth is so hot I can't get my breath.
Good-by."</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Pomfret Smith, unlike Jeffries,
had come back. She greeted Miss Patterson
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Patterson, I've remembered
all about it now. You see, it starts this
way. There is a girl, a New York girl,
who has married an English lord, or,
rather, she is just going to marry him&mdash;the
brother of the first man she was engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to steps in, and tells her that the
lord isn't genuine, and he presents her
maid with a jeweled pin which his
mother, the countess, received from her
husband&mdash;her first husband, that is&mdash;three
days after the battle of&mdash;oh, I don't
know the name of the battle&mdash;the
'Charge of the Light Brigade,' it was, and
he was in that&mdash;no, his uncle was, and he
said to his tent-mate, the night before
the battle: 'Charley, I'm not coming out
of this alive, and my cousin will be the
lawful heir, but I want you to take this
and dig with it underneath the floor of
the old summer house, and the papers that
you will find there will make Gerald a
rich man.' And so he took it and when he
got to Washington he handed it to the old
family servant who hadn't seen him for
sixty years, and then dropped dead, so
they never knew whether he was the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
one or only the impostor, and so just as
the wedding was about to take place the
uncle&mdash;he was a senator&mdash;said to the
bishop, who was going to marry them:
'<i>Please get off this line, I am using it!</i>'
And so it never took place, after all. Now,
can you tell me what the name of the book
is, Miss Patterson?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am afraid I do not recognize
it. It sounds a little like Mrs. Humphry
Ward and Ouida and Frances
Hodgson Burnett, and someone else, all
at once. Was it by any of them, Mrs.
Smith?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I am sure it was not. Why, I
am surprised&mdash;I thought you would
know it now, without any hesitation!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then. Good-by."</p>

<p>The last in a tone as acid and cold as
lemon ice. It seemed to express Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Smith's opinion of all librarians. Miss
Patterson was much grieved, but the
telephone bell rang again before she had
time to reflect.</p>

<p>"Is this the library? Oh, yes. I wonder
if you have a life of Mrs. Browning?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think so. What would you
like to know about her?"</p>

<p>"Well, there&mdash;I am certainly glad.
This is Miss Crumpet, you know! Miss
Hortense Crumpet. I have had such a
time. Have you the book right there? I
do wish you would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you will wait just a minute, I will
send for the book&mdash;I haven't it here."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you so much."</p>

<p>The book was fetched, and Miss Patterson
informed Miss Crumpet that she now
held the volume ready.</p>

<p>"Have you it right there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I want to see a picture of Mrs.
Browning. We have a portrait here, and
my aunt says it is George Eliot, and I
know it is Mrs. Browning. Now, if you
could just hold up the book&mdash;why, how
perfectly ridiculous of me! I can't see it
over the telephone, can I? Why, how
absolutely absurd! I never thought at all!
I was going to come to the library for it,
only it is so horrid and rainy, and then I
remembered that I saw in the paper about
your answering questions by telephone,
and I thought, why, how nice, I'll just call
them up on the 'phone&mdash;and now it won't
do me any good at all, will it?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"And I'll have to come to the library
after all. Oh, dear! Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p>The bell rang again as soon as the receiver
had been replaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello! How are you for pigs' feet
to-day?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"Pigs' feet! How many yer got?"</p>

<p>"This is the public library. Did you
call for us?"</p>

<p>"Who? The what? No; I'm trying
to get Packer and Pickleums. I don't want
no public library. What's the matter with
that girl at central? This is the third
time&mdash;"</p>

<p>His conversation ended abruptly as the
receiver was hung up. Miss Patterson
was soon called again. Mrs. Pomfret
Smith was once more unto the breach.</p>

<p>"Miss Patterson? I've remembered
some more about that book, now. It had
a bright red cover and the name of it
was printed in gilt letters. It was about
so high&mdash;oh, I forgot, you can't see over
the telephone, can you? Well, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
about as big as books usually are, you
know, and it was quite thick&mdash;oh, it must
have had a hundred or two hundred pages&mdash;perhaps
more than that, I am not sure.
And the front picture was of a girl&mdash;the
heroine, I guess, and a man, and he had
his arms around her and she was looking
up into his face. <i>Now</i>, you can remember
what book it was, can't you, Miss
Patterson?"</p>

<h2 class="p4">A LITERARY MEET</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a><br /><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2 large">A LITERARY MEET</p>

<p class="pn2">Dr. Gotthold, formerly librarian
to H. H. Prince Otto of Grunewald, has
very kindly forwarded a copy of the
"Olympian Times" containing an account
of the recent field day, gymkhana, and general
meet of the Fictitious and Historical
Characters' Amateur Athletic Association.
It is reproduced here verbatim:</p>

<p>On the morning of the meet everyone
was delighted to see that fair weather prevailed.
As it was well known that the
pious Æneas was going to act as one of the
field judges, a good many persons had expected
that his old enemy Æolus would
contrive some kind of a kibosh in the shape
of high winds. But nothing of the sort
happened, and thousands streamed out to
the grounds in the best of spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The assemblage was a brilliant one. The
"Times's" representative noticed a number
of automobile parties. A magnificent
new car belonging to Helen of Troy carried
its fair owner, and a select party consisting
of Iseult of Ireland, Mme. Anna
Karenina, Paris, Tristram and Don Juan.
Another car, belonging to Baron Chevrial,
contained that nobleman, as well as Mr.
Dorian Gray, Iago, and James Steerforth,
Esq. A special railway car belonging to
Cr&oelig;sus, King of Lydia, brought a large
party, including Omar Khayyam, Comus,
Shylock and the Marquis of Carabas.</p>

<p>The football game was scheduled as the
first event. The two teams came on the
field at a dog-trot led by their respective
captains. This was the line-up:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="pbq p1">Officials: Referee, Sherlock Holmes; umpire,
King Arthur; field judge, Henry Esmond; linesmen,
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p1">We do not know who was responsible
for the make-up of the teams, and we cannot
enter into a detailed description of the
game, but we must say that a more hopelessly
one-sided affair we have never witnessed.
The team captained by the Prince
of Denmark had about as much chance
against that led by the swift-footed son of
Peleus as Miss Lindsay's Select School for
Girls would against the Yale 'varsity.</p>

<p>Both teams were badly off for tackles,
and while we do not wish to criticise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fairly good game played by Sir Launcelot
and Captain Brassbound, we cannot help
remarking that neither Mercutio nor Raffles
had any business in that position.</p>

<p>We understand that Mr. Raffles formerly
had some reputation as a cricketer,
and we advise him to stick to that game.
As for Mercutio (whose reputation, we believe,
rests chiefly on a rather unsuccessful
duel in Verona a number of years ago)
it was plain that his was the weakest part
of the line. Time and again Hector tore
through Mercutio for big gains.</p>

<p>Indeed, if Hamlet had had the sense to
keep pounding at left tackle his team might
at least have scored one touchdown. But
instead, Captain Hamlet would wander off
between the plays, muttering to himself
something about to punt or not to punt,
and the quarter, Ortheris, was left to run
the team alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>This was unfortunate, for although Mr.
Ortheris played a quick and snappy game
himself, his signals were badly chosen. We
believe that the climate of India, where he
used to reside, affected him in some unfavorable
manner, so that he is subject to occasional
fits of madness. What with the
peculiarity of the captain of his team in
this respect, it seemed as if their side were
badly handicapped. Umslopogaas played
brilliantly at right end, but it was no use.</p>

<p>What in the name of common sense impelled
their coach to put Sir John Falstaff
at center? The day has gone by when
weight is the only consideration in that position.
Moreover, you cannot train for
football on sack and capons. Ursus made
the old knight look like thirty cents in counterfeit
money. Luckily he was taken out
at the end of the first period&mdash;wheezing
badly&mdash;and Hercules took his place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The game ended as might have been expected&mdash;34
to 0, in favor of Achilles's
team.</p>

<p>The football game had occupied most of
the morning, but after it was over there
was still time for the spectators to witness
some minor contests before luncheon.</p>

<p>Many wandered over to the tennis
courts. A set of mixed doubles was in
progress, with Lady Macbeth and Pudd'nhead
Wilson opposed by Morgan le Fay
and Mr. Isaacs. The Queen of Scotland
and her partner from Missouri took a love
set at the beginning of the match, but the
second set was hotly contested, and finally
went to Morgan le Fay and Mr. Isaacs,
7-5.</p>

<p>Morgan le Fay won ace after ace, proving
herself the mistress of a very powerful
and puzzling service, while Mr. Isaacs
covered the court with the agility of a cat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
They took the final set, and the match,
winning easily with a score of 6-1.</p>

<p>Gentlemen's singles were also being
played, and at the time when our representative
had to leave the courts the tournament
was practically won by Nathan
Burke, as the only undefeated players remaining
were Hugh Wynne and Alfred
Jingle.</p>

<p>Under the trees near by, some games
of cards were in progress. Miss Lily Bart
was instructing Diana of the Crossways,
Major Pendennis, and Mr. Pickwick in
auction bridge.</p>

<p>Horatius, hearing the word "bridge"
mentioned, hurried over to the table, but
when he saw what was going on, lost his
interest and walked away toward the golf
links with Sir Patrick Spens.</p>

<p>At another table Mr. John Oakhurst
seemed to have obliterated the color-line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
for he was deeply engaged in a three-handed
game of poker with Rev. Mr. Johnsing
and Brother Cyanide Whiffles of the
Thompson Street Poker Club.</p>

<p>Everybody was interested in aviation,
and when the rumor got about that the
aviators were going to make some flights
there was a general rush toward the
hangars. Only three made ascents, however&mdash;Darius
Green, Icarus, and Peter
Pan. The first tried one of his celebrated
spiral descents, and of course came to the
ground with a crash. His machine was a
total wreck.</p>

<p>Icarus did not have much better luck&mdash;he
was carried off to the hospital. He rose
to an enormous height, and is said to have
beaten all previous records for altitude,
but something went wrong with his biplane,
and he fell with terrible force.</p>

<p>King Arthur, his duties as umpire of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
football game finished, challenged Macbeth
to nine holes of golf, and beat the
Scottish king, on his own heath, so to
speak. King Arthur's drives were magnificent,
showing that the arm that once
wielded Excalibur had not weakened since
its owner's retirement to the island valley
of Avilion. They play very classy golf in
Avilion.</p>

<p>Macbeth's putts were beautiful to watch,
but as he usually arrived on the green in
at least two strokes more than the monarch
of the Round Table, they did him very
little good. Twice on the drive he sliced,
and the ball went wide into a grove of
trees. When he asked his caddie the name
of the grove, and the youth replied,
"Birnam Wood, your Majesty," the
former Thane of Cawdor turned pale
and hammered the ground with his
brassie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>When the royal players came to the
ninth tee, Macbeth was heard to mutter,
"What though I foozle, top, and slice, and
thou opposed be now three up&mdash;yet will I
try the last&mdash;lay on, Mac&mdash;I mean, it's
your honor, Arthur!"</p>

<p>King Arthur did the difficult ninth hole
in bogey, but poor old Macbeth plowed
up the turf all along the fair green, and
finally holed out amid a burst of Scotch
profanity sad to hear.</p>

<p>Neither of their queens was present&mdash;her
Majesty of Scotland being engaged, as
we have said, on the tennis courts, while
Queen Guinevere&mdash;well, it is enough for
anyone to read the line-up of one of the
football teams to know that Queen Guinevere
was still lingering around the clubhouse,
waiting for the players to come out.
We have no wish to mention unpleasant
things, and we abhor scandals&mdash;still facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
are facts, and it is the duty of a conscientious
newspaper to record them.</p>

<p>Down on the lake that expert submarine
navigator, Captain Nemo, was entertaining
a large crowd by the maneuvers
of his celebrated boat, the Nautilus, and
an exhibition of skillful paddling was offered
by Hiawatha in his canoe.</p>

<p>The sound of revolver shots drew
a number of spectators to see a match
between Sherlock Holmes and The
Virginian.</p>

<p>The greatest throng, however, surrounded
a fencing bout between Cyrano
de Bergerac and D'Artagnan. Cyrano
had some dispute with the referee, before
beginning, on the question of whether he
should be allowed to compose a poem while
he was fencing. He alleged that it was his
custom to do so, and that he could not
possibly appear at his best if the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
were denied. His opponent objected, however.</p>

<p>"Just a ballade, monsieur," pleaded Cyrano,
"or at least, a vilanelle."</p>

<p>"Cut out the poet business, Cy!"
shouted someone&mdash;it is suspected that
Chimmie Fadden was the man, and the referee
so ruled. D'Artagnan was declared
the winner of the match that followed.</p>

<p class="p2">After luncheon the whole assemblage
were gathered about the diamond for the
long expected game of baseball. This was
to be played between two scrub teams
known as "The Boys" and "The Old
Men"&mdash;though some of the latter (notably
Romeo and Richard Feverel) objected
to the classification. These were the
nines:</p>

<p class="p1">The Old Men banged into Huck Finn's
delivery for three hits right at the start
and came back for a couple more in the
second inning. Huck, however, began to
look better, and after the fourth he was
swinging the ball over in great shape. The
Old Men made but two hits in the last
seven innings and none in the last five.
Kim was the star on the attack. Up four
times he made just that many hits, one
going for a double.</p>

<p>One of Kim's drives came fast on a
long bound and hit Romeo in the face.
Kim drove in a pair of runs with his
double and started the scoring for The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Boys in the first inning, while in the sixth
he himself came across with the tally which
eventually proved the winning one.</p>

<p>Hotspur pitched a fair game. The
greatest difference came in the defensive
work of the teams. The Boys went through
without a break.</p>

<p>Tom Jones had a case of the wabbles
for The Old Men, and there was a lot of
uncertainty about the work of the infield
because of the breaks he made. The outfielders
for The Old Men were also having
trouble fielding the ball clean and throwing
to the plate.</p>

<p>Sam Weller was the one chap on his
team who was going at speed. He pulled
off one play which belongs in the Hall of
Fame, Joe Harper losing a hit and The
Boys two runs as a result.</p>

<p>With Allan Quartermain and Leatherstocking
down in the first inning, Friar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Tuck fattened his batting average a bit
by bunting and beating the throw to first.
Romeo put the ball over Tom Brown's
head up against the bleacher front and
legged it around to third, while Friar Tuck
scored, a fumble by Frank Nelson on Tom
Brown's return cinching things. Sam
Weller lambed a single to center and Romeo
scored. Sam was out stealing a moment
later.</p>

<p>Tom Sawyer got The Boys away in fine
style with a smash to left for a single.
Joe Harper drew a walk. Tom Bailey
sacrificed, and Kim drove a hot grounder
right through Allan Quartermain and
wound up on second before the outfielders
could get the leather back to the infield.
Tom Sawyer and Joe Harper came home.
Tom Brown popped up a foul to Romeo,
and Kim was doubled off second after the
catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Both teams kept right on scoring in the
second. Dicky Feverel got The Old Men
away well with a single and then stole
second. Tom Jones put him on third with
a sacrifice, and Don Quixote gave him the
opportunity to score on a long fly to The
Bad Boy. Hotspur whaled a fly over
Kim's head. The famous scrapper tried
to make it a home run, but was caught at
the plate on Jack Hall's return.</p>

<p>In The Boys' half, after two had gone,
Mark the Match Boy reached first on
a fumble by Tom Jones. Huck Finn
drove a single to right. Tom Sawyer put
up a hot fly which Allan Quartermain
failed to get, and Mark the Match Boy
came home, Huck Finn going to third.
Tom Sawyer stole second. Joe Harper
drove a red-hot one over the bag at second,
and it looked like a sure single and two
more runs for the kids. Sam Weller went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
over for a sensational one-hand stop and
threw Joe out at first. It was a phenomenal
play. That settled the scoring until
the sixth inning. Kim got a single, Tom
Brown bunted and was safe when Tom
Jones fumbled. Jack Hall sacrificed the
pair along, and when Hotspur passed
Frank Nelson the sacks were full. Mark
the Match Boy raised a fly to Friar Tuck
and Kim scored on the catch. Huck Finn
fanned.</p>

<p>The Boys' final run came in the eighth
on Jack Hall's single, Mark the Match
Boy's grounder through the lion hunter,
and a single by Tom Sawyer. The score:</p>

<p class="pc2 large">"THE DESERT ISLAND TEST"</p>

<p class="pn2">A roll of papers containing the following
narrative has been forwarded to
the "Transcript" by Captain "Sol" Farr
of the Gloucester fishing schooner "Salt
Mackerel."</p>

<p>Captain Farr discovered them, floating
about in an olive bottle, a few miles off
Boston Light. As soon as he had examined
the papers (which are slightly damaged
by salt water and olive vinegar) he
perceived their bearing upon an important
literary question of the day, and very properly
sent them to "The Librarian."</p>

<p>The original papers are to be deposited
in the Ezra Beesly Free Public Library
of Baxter (Captain Farr's native town),
where in a week or two they may be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
by anyone applying to the librarian, or
one of his assistants, between 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and
8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>The narrative, written in a shaky hand,
on twelve sheets of note paper, contains
the following remarkable statement:</p>

<p class="p2">I, Professor Horatio B. Fassett, M.A.,
Ph.D., write this appeal (with a perfectly
detestable fountain-pen) on an
uninhabited and (so far as I am aware)
unknown island, somewhere off the eastern
coast of South America, on (as near
as I can guess) the twelfth of December,
1908. For two years have I dwelt in
wretchedness in this place, a most unwilling
(and unsuccessful) follower of Robinson
Crusoe. I know that it is customary
in such appeals as this, which I am about
(in the words of the burial service) to
commit to the deep, to give, approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
at least, the latitude and longitude of my
desert isle, in order that searching parties
(which I earnestly pray may be sent for
me) shall know where to look.</p>

<p>Alas! all my studies have been devoted
to literature and the fine arts, and although
I have certain instruments which poor
Captain Bucko used to ascertain the ship's
position, I am as helpless with them as an
infant. True, I have endeavored to look
at the sun with them&mdash;and the moon, too,
but I could not observe that those bodies
had any than their usual aspect when thus
viewed. As for the signs which are engraved
on the surface of these instruments,
I could copy them down here in hope that
they might give a clue to those expert in
navigation; but as they are, so far as I
can see, exactly the same as those which
were on the instruments when we left New
York, I fear it would be of no avail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The only hint, then, of the geographical
position of this island must come from my
narrative. I beseech whatever person finds
it to send news of me without delay to the
president and faculty of Upidee University,
where, alas, I suppose my chair (the
James A. Rewbarb professorship of German
Literature) is already filled.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for me to speak
much of my career. In the obituary notices
that doubtless appeared when the ship
"Hardtack" failed to arrive at Valparaiso,
I suppose it was stated that I was the
only passenger on that unfortunate vessel.
I am, I believe, the only survivor of her
wreck. Worn out with revising proof of
the second edition of my doctor's thesis
("That the umlaut should be placed one-fourth
of a millimetre higher than is now
the custom") I had, at the advice of my
physician, embarked on the "Hardtack,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sailing from New York for Valparaiso,
Sept. 9, 1906.</p>

<p>The voyage was uneventful for about
four weeks, and life on the ship (which
I think, by the way, was called by the captain
a "brig") was not distasteful to me.
One morning, however, I heard a commotion
overhead, and going upstairs found
Captain Bucko in a state of great excitement.
I asked him the cause, and he replied
that the mate had put the brig in irons.</p>

<p>I had often read of this custom in times
of mutiny, so I remarked: "I suppose it
was by your orders, Captain?"</p>

<p>He did not reply, and I presently learned
the cause of his anxiety. They did not
seem to be able to make the ship go ahead
in a straight line, and, to make matters
worse, a rocky island on which the waves
were breaking violently, had been discovered
on the right hand side of the vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>I ought to explain that I am not perfectly
familiar with all the technicalities
of ship-navigation, and I retain only a
confused idea of what followed.</p>

<p>I know that I was ordered to get into a
small rowboat which was jumping about
in a most alarming fashion at one side of
the ship, and that when I refused to take
such a ridiculous step, I was seized by two
sailors and thrown into the boat. I must
have struck my head on something, for I
knew nothing else until I found myself lying
on a beach, pounded and bruised by the
waves. I got up, and staggered to a place
where the sand was dry, and there I fell
again exhausted.</p>

<p>Of the captain and the crew of the
"Hardtack" I have never seen a trace, except
a coat belonging to the mate, which
was washed on shore a few days later.
Their small boat was probably tipped over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
by the waves, and they were all drowned.
It is strange that I, the only one of them
unfamiliar with the ocean, should have
been spared. The "Hardtack" itself evidently
became hitched on a rock some little
distance from the shore, for there it stayed
for part of that day, with great waves beating
upon it. At last the masts fell down,
and in a few days the ship was broken in
pieces, till nothing remained. Many of
these fragments floated to the shore, with
various articles from the cargo.</p>

<p>For the first three days I was excessively
miserable. I was forced to sleep
out of doors on the first night, and when
I felt hungry the next morning, there was
nothing to eat. My tastes are simple, but
my habits are regular, and in my rooms at
Upidee, as well as in the "Hardtack," I
was accustomed to have a cup of coffee at
half-past seven each morning. Now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
searched the shore for some hours, but
could find nothing except some mussels or
clams and a few starfish. The starfish
were very tough, and not at all agreeable in
taste, and though a Little Neck clam, properly
iced and served with lemon and other
condiments, is not an ill beginning to a
dinner, I cannot pretend that I found these
shellfish, eaten raw on a windy beach, other
than nauseous.</p>

<p>But I hasten over these troubles and
also over my discovery of a large number
of boxes of food which floated ashore,
three days later, from the wreck. Some of
it was edible and it sufficed until I found
other means of sustenance on the island.
Of my discovery of two deserted huts (relics
of former castaways, perhaps), of my
domestication of several wild goats, whom
I learned (not without difficulty) to milk,
and of my capture of fish in the inlet&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
all these things I need not write. My
troubles are not material, but intellectual.
And they are so great that I earnestly implore
some one to come to my rescue.</p>

<p>To make my sufferings clear I must remind
the reader that I am that Horatio
Fassett who won the $500 prize from
"Somebody's Magazine" four years ago
for the best answer to the question: "If
you were cast away on a desert island what
one hundred books would you prefer to
have with you?"</p>

<p>I worked hard to compile my list, and it
was generally agreed to be the most
scholarly selection of one hundred titles
ever made. The publishers of "Somebody's
Magazine" not only paid me the
$500, but presented me with a copy, well
bound, of each of the books. These
(packed securely in a water-tight box,
so constructed as to float) accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
me in the "Hardtack," and I need tell no
scholar that during my first days on this
island, as I walked the beach and watched
the remnants of the vessel float ashore, it
was not so much for cases of concentrated
soup nor tins of baked-beans that I
yearned, as for my box of the "One
Hundred Best Books."</p>

<p>At last it came! That was a happy day&mdash;about
a week after my arrival on the
island. I saw the box, tossed about in the
surf, and I dashed in and secured it. I was
now living, with comparative comfort, in
one of the huts; and thither I carried the
books. I was overjoyed. It was my privilege
to put my books to the test&mdash;something
that had never been accorded to the
compilers of any of the similar lists which
have been made in such profusion. With
trembling hands (and a screwdriver) I
opened the box and took out the books.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
They were in perfect order&mdash;the waterproof
box had been well made.</p>

<p>From this point, I copy the entries in
my diary, and let them tell the rest of my
dismal story.</p>

<p>"Oct. 16. I arranged the books neatly,
this afternoon, on top of some empty biscuit
boxes. They were all there: Tasso,
Homer, Don Quixote, The Divine Comedy,
Browning, and the rest. They looked delightful,
and reminded me of my study at
Upidee. I wonder if I shall ever see that
study again, and I wonder what will become
of the second edition of my thesis
on the umlaut. It was to appear next
April, and now who knows whether I shall
be there ready to reply to the attacks which
I know it will provoke?</p>

<p>"From this gloomy line of thought, I
turned again to the Hundred Best Books.
Which should I begin to read? There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
were my beloved Goethe and Schiller&mdash;should
I start with them? I took a volume,
and had opened it, when it occurred to me
that I had not yet gone that day to the
high rock where I looked for passing ships.
I put Goethe back on the biscuit box, and
spent an anxious afternoon staring at the
ocean. But I saw nothing.</p>

<p>"The evening I spent in trying to arrange
some fishing lines, as the firelight&mdash;my
only illumination&mdash;is not favorable
for reading to one afflicted with astigmatism.
I miss the electric droplight
that I used at Upidee, or even the kerosene
lamp in the cabin of the 'Hardtack.'
I must try to make some candles.</p>

<p>"Oct. 17. I passed the morning in trying
to tame a wild goat&mdash;or perhaps I
had better say in trying to induce one to
graze outside my cabin, instead of investigating
the interior. They are not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
shy, but are inclined to be rather sociable.
In the afternoon I took Goethe with me to
the high rock, where I sat with the volume
on my knee keeping a watch for vessels.
I cannot say that I read much. German
literature makes me feel rather homesick,
and I find brings me recollections of the
distressing recitations of last year's freshman
class.</p>

<p>"Oct. 18. When I went to the lookout
to-day I took Browning with me. Good
heavens, I found I can no longer read
Browning! This was an astounding state
of things, and I had to examine myself
rather sharply. I remembered that I had
never for a moment been in doubt, when
I made up my list, of including Browning.
I had read, twenty years ago, the
'Dramatic Lyrics,' with the greatest of
pleasure, but the longer poems had seemed
to me rather dull, and indeed a large proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the poet's work was intensely
irritating to me on account of its needless
and exasperating obscurity. At the time
I did not consider this a cause for worry.
Browning was a great poet&mdash;everyone
said so; his treasures did not lie on the
surface&mdash;one must dive below in order to
find the rich pearls which lay concealed
there. I remember using this metaphor in
a lecture that I delivered before the
Woman's Club of Buffalo. I had always
intended to study the longer poems; but
I had never done it. Now they were unreadable
to me. As for the 'Dramatic
Lyrics,' they did not charm me as formerly.
I found myself longing for a volume
of Wordsworth or Tennyson. Neither
was included in my Best Books, though I
cannot see now, for the life of me, why I
didn't include Tennyson. Could it have
been because his poems are easy to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and that I thought it would seem
more 'scholarly' to put in Browning?</p>

<p>"Oct. 20. I have not been to the high
rock lately except for a brief visit after
breakfast. I have had a little rheumatism&mdash;not
being used to sleeping in draughty
cabins. The goats have been a source of
entertainment to me, and I have caught
some crabs, which I keep in a little pool of
salt water near the cabin. They are amusing
to watch, and toasted crab-meat is far
from bad at supper time. I kill one with a
stick and then broil him on a hot stone.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I tried reading again, but
I am bound to confess that there was not
much solace in it. The Odyssey I soon
put down&mdash;too much shipwreck and
wandering in strange lands. There is no
Penelope waiting for me, even if I ever
get home alive. And the thought of Ithaca
reminded me of Cornell and Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
von Füglemann, who is all ready to tear
my thesis on the umlaut to pieces. Shakspeare
I picked up, but the first play I
opened to was 'The Tempest.' I closed
Shakspeare and put him back.</p>

<p>"Nov. 25. Nothing has happened
worth recording for weeks. Once I saw
smoke, from a steamboat, I suppose, but
smoke did not do me any good.</p>

<p>"There is something the matter with
this list of Best Books. For one thing,
they are most of them so tragic. I would
give anything for a volume of Mr. Dooley.
But that is not all. I have always realized
that the great literature of the world is
very largely sombre, and I have no more
sympathy now than I ever had with the
people who want to read nothing but that
which keeps them on a broad grin. Even
in my dreary situation I could read tragedy,
but I have brought precious little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
tragedy that I care for. No doubt most of
my books are great monuments of literature,
but I am afraid I must have forgotten,
when I wrote my list, how few of
these books I read now. I must have put
them in because they are praised by writers
of text-books, and because it seemed the
proper thing to do.</p>

<p>"As I go over my reading for the past
five years at Upidee, in what do I find it
to consist? First, the literature and text-books
of my profession. Second, current
books&mdash;history, biography, art criticism,
and an infrequent novel or book of verse.
There are not many living novelists or
poets that I care about. It makes me
fairly rage when I think that I hesitated
between 'Pickwick' and 'Jerusalem Delivered'
when I made up my list, and
finally decided in favor of the latter as
more weighty&mdash;which it certainly is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I used my copy to help sink a lobster
trap the other day.</p>

<p>"Almost the only novel which I condescended
to include in my list is 'Don
Quixote,' and why did I do that? Because
it has been praised for three hundred years,
I suppose, instead of for only forty or
fifty. It is about the only humorous work
which I did include&mdash;and except for
places here and there it is a dreary waste.</p>

<p>"Aug. 10, 1907. It is now months since
I have had the courage to face this diary.
I dreamed last night that I had wandered
into a book shop. There were rows of
books, for any one of which I would have
gladly given my whole celebrated One
Hundred. (At least, I would give what
is left of them. 'Don Quixote' has been
used to paste over cracks in the walls of
my cabin. 'Orlando Furioso' served to
boil some sea-gulls' eggs one morning for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
breakfast, when I was short of firewood,
and the 'Koran' fell into the fire one night
when I hurled it at some animal&mdash;a fox,
I think, that came into the hut.) The sight
of that bookshop made me weep. I had
seized a volume of Tennyson, Stevenson's
Letters, and 'Sherlock Holmes,' when the
shopkeeper jumped over his counter at me&mdash;and
I woke, sobbing.</p>

<p>"Sept. 1, 1907. One of the goats ate
the Æneid to-day.</p>

<p>"Sept. 2. The goat is ill, and I have
had to give it one of my few pepsin
tablets."</p>

<p>This is the last entry from the diary
that I need transcribe. Over a year has
elapsed since I wrote it; and my case is
desperate. I will now seal up this narrative
in a bottle, and throw it into the sea.
Come to my rescue, or I fear I shall go
mad!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>

<p class="pc2 large">THE CONVERSATION ROOM</p>

<p class="pn2">To the Honorable, the Board of Directors
of the Blankville Public Library. Gentlemen:
I am forced to lay my complaint
before you, because your librarian, Dr.
W. M. Pierce, so I am told, has sailed for
Europe to attend a meeting of librarians in
Brussels, whence he will not return for six
or seven weeks.</p>

<p>My name is doubtless familiar to you,
but perhaps you are not aware that I am
engaged in an important piece of research
in your library. When I state that my
work is an inquiry into the Indo-Iranian
origins of the noun 'Fuddy-dud' and
its possible derivation from the Semitic,
you will understand that it requires
the closest possible application and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
entire freedom from interruptions and
distractions.</p>

<p>When I began my researches in your library,
six days ago, I presented letters to
Dr. Pierce. He very kindly installed me
in an alcove, where he had placed a table
and chairs, and where he allowed me to
assemble the books needed in my studies&mdash;some
one hundred and thirty or forty
volumes. These, together with my papers
and writing materials, are permitted to
remain on the table from one day to another,
as obviously it would be inconvenient
for me to have to call for them each
morning.</p>

<p>It is my custom to begin work at nine
o'clock every day, and to continue (save
for an hour at noon) until 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> For a
few days all went very well, and I was
making fair progress in my work. But
during the last two days, and particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
yesterday, I have been subjected to such
annoyances that all of my studies have
been held at a standstill.</p>

<p>The library, and particularly the remote
part of it in which my alcove is situated,
has been little frequented during this hot
weather. Yesterday, however, an invasion
began. The alcove next to mine was
visited by a succession of incongruous, inconsequent
persons whose conversation
made it utterly impossible for me to work.
A complaint to Miss Mayhew, the assistant
in charge of the library, elicited the
fact that conversation is allowed in this
alcove.</p>

<p>It is out of the question for me to move
my work, as an inspection of the building
has shown that there is no other spot where
the light suits my eyes.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, totally unable to
do any serious work, I took down, in shorthand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the stream of driveling talk that occurred
in that alcove. I now transcribe it
here, in order that your honorable board
may have an opportunity of judging the
nature of the interruptions to which I am
subjected. After giving them due consideration
I trust that you will be able to
take action in the matter. In the meanwhile
my philological researches are of
necessity suspended.</p>

<p>I returned to my work, after luncheon,
at two o'clock. The alcove next mine was
occupied by two persons&mdash;a young man
and woman, both about twenty years of
age. Their talk reached me, and made it
impossible for me to follow any consecutive
line of thought. At the time when I
began to take down their conversation,
the young woman was saying:</p>

<p>"What's 'Gibbon'? People are always
talking about reading Gibbon&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
then they look awfully wise. I've never
dared to ask what they mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's Gibbon's history of Rome&mdash;the
'Fall of the Roman Empire,' or something
like that."</p>

<p>"Have you ever read it?"</p>

<p>"Great Scott, no! It's in about a dozen
volumes&mdash;I don't know how many. I've
read some of it&mdash;they made us do it,
freshman year."</p>

<p>"Is it awfully dry? Would I like it?"</p>

<p>"It's pretty fierce. Nothing to Grote,
though&mdash;Grote's 'History of Greece'&mdash;that's
the limit!"</p>

<p>"Gibbon is a man then? I wasn't sure
what he was."</p>

<p>"Yes; he's the author."</p>

<p>"Oh, why, I've seen him! How stupid
of me! I saw him when I was in Baltimore
visiting the Ashfords. Why, he's
just the <i>grandest</i> thing you ever saw in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
your life. He came at the end of a great
long procession, with the dearest little
choir-boys at the head, and he was all in
scarlet robes, and a great long train, with
two more little boys holding up his train,
and he had the loveliest lace collar&mdash;I just
went crazy over him! And I saw him on
the street afterwards, too, only he didn't
have on his scarlet robes then. He had on
black clothes, and a tall hat, and when he
lifted his hat to someone he had on a little
red skull-cap underneath it. Oh, he's a
perfect dear. I'd like to read his book&mdash;I
wonder if they've got it here?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;that's not the man. This
was an Englishman&mdash;his first name was&mdash;I
forget what it was. Anyhow he's
been dead a long time. He was a very fat
man, and he proposed to Mme. de Staël,
or George Sand, or one of those women,
and when he got down on his knees he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
so fat that he couldn't get up again, and
had to ask her to help him up."</p>

<p>"How perfectly ridiculous! I hate fat
men. I hope she didn't accept him! Did
she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to read his book,
anyhow. But I've simply got to read
something that sounds cultured and
learned. Aunt Ella has been at me again;
she says this is a good time, during vacation.
Fanny Brooks has a great long list
of the books she has read&mdash;I am so tired
of having Fanny Brooks thrown at me!
She never reads anything interesting, or
does anything at all for pleasure. She
ought to be a nun. Can't you think of
something that will impress Aunt Ella&mdash;something
that sounds awfully impressive
and dry and cultured, but really is easy to
read?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, let me see, how about
Browning?"</p>

<p>"I've read him."</p>

<p>"Like him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It seems to be a tough proposition.
What does your Aunt Ella read? Why
don't you take some of her books?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. She reads 'Women
of the Renaissance' and things like that.
I tried to read some of hers, and I told her
I didn't like them. She said I couldn't
expect to, because I haven't any foundation.
How do you get a foundation&mdash;that's
what I'd like to know! Aunt Ella
is perfectly dippy on Italian art. Gracious,
is that clock right? It's nearly
three, and I haven't done any improving
reading."</p>

<p>"Look here, it's a corking afternoon&mdash;you
don't want to waste it in this joint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Let's go down to the boathouse and get
my canoe."</p>

<p>"I'd like to. But what will I say to
Aunt Ella?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll take some book with us,
and you can read while I paddle. What's
that one on that shelf?&mdash;it looks dry as the
deuce. Here you are, just the thing:&mdash;'Notes
on the Architectural Antiquities
of the District of Gower in Glamorganshire'&mdash;that
would make a hit with Aunt
Ella, all right!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound very interesting."</p>

<p>"You're right, there. Well, how will
this one do? 'The Recently Discovered
Cromlech near Is-sur-Tille.'"</p>

<p>"What on earth is a cromlech?"</p>

<p>"You can search me."</p>

<p>"Let's take them both. I'll get them
charged at the desk, and meet you outside.
I'll read you all about the cromlech&mdash;if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
there are any words in the book
I can pronounce."</p>

<p>With this they went out, and I endeavored
to take up my work. Before I
could make the slightest progress, however,
two more persons entered the alcove.
These, to judge from the conversation,
were small boys. I had to sit and
listen to this chatter:</p>

<p>"What yer got?"</p>

<p>"'Tinkham Brothers' Tide-mill.' What
you got?"</p>

<p>"One of Henty's."</p>

<p>"What one?"</p>

<p>"'The Cat of Boobasts.'"</p>

<p>"Aw, that ain't any good. Why didn't
yer get 'By England's Aid'?"</p>

<p>"'T warn't in."</p>

<p>"Yes, 't is, too. Jimmy Goodrich just
brought it back."</p>

<p>"Well, the teacher won't let yer have it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the same day it come in. An' she won't
let me give back this one now."</p>

<p>"Aw, you're dead easy! Don't yer
know how to work that?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why, just go down there, an' when she
ain't lookin' stick that one you got behind
some other books on the shelf. Then go
round to that wheel thing near her desk, 'By
England's Aid' is on that, an' put it under
your arm when she ain't lookin' an' go out
quick with it. Then you can come round
to-morrer, an' get the other one, an' give it
back, an' get your card, an' you can stick
back 'By England's Aid' any time. Bring it
in under your coat, when you come with it."</p>

<p>"Gee, that's great! Have you ever
tried it?"</p>

<p>"Have I? I've had six books at home
to once, an' two more on my cards."</p>

<p>"How many cards you got?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two. Ain't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't got but one."</p>

<p>"Didn't they make you take a green
card?"</p>

<p>"No; what good are they?"</p>

<p>"They ain't no good, but the teacher
makes yer take one. You can get story
books on the white card, but the other is
for non-fiction."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, school books, an' a lot of rotten
things like that."</p>

<p>"What do yer want them for?"</p>

<p>"You don't want 'em&mdash;excep' a few of
'em. 'The American Boy's Handy Book'
is one of 'em. That's all right. Most of
'em are bum. But if you take 'em, it
makes a hit with the teacher. They want
yer to read 'em. I got a prize last winter
for readin' more'n any other feller that
comes to the liberry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee, you must have hated to read all
them school books."</p>

<p>"Aw, I didn't read 'em, you mutt. I
jus' took 'em home, an' brought 'em back
in a day or two. Say, have you ever read
any of Alger's?"</p>

<p>"Yup&mdash;two of 'em. Eddie Meaghan
let me take two of his. You can't get 'em
here. I wish you could, though. They're
great."</p>

<p>"I know. I tried to get 'em off the
teacher down stairs. She said they warn't
nice. I says yes they are too, for my
brother who's studyin' to be a lawyer read
'em. She said she'd give me some book
that was better, an' she give me one called
'Brothers of the Air.'"</p>

<p>"Was it any good?"</p>

<p>"Rotten. But Danny Corrigan, the
bootblack, told me about a place, a liberry
in back of Schmidt's cigar store where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
can get Alger's an' Old Sleuth, and Di'mond
Dick, an' Bowery Billy. Gee, the
teacher'd have a fit if she sees them&mdash;she
took one of Old Sleuth's away from Jimmy
Goodrich, an' burned it up, an' wrote to
his mother about it."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' down to the children's room,
now. Do you s'pose I can work that gag
now, an' get 'By England's Aid'?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I'll go down, too, an' show yer
how."</p>

<p class="p2">Whereupon these two nuisances departed.
Really it seems amazing that
children and frivolous persons should be
allowed in libraries. As it was four o'clock
now, I did hope to be allowed to study in
peace for what remained of the afternoon.
But the hope was vain, for inside of five
minutes two women came into that alcove,
that Cave of the Winds, as I may call it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>They apparently brought some books
with them, and they instantly began to
discuss them in a manner that drove every
idea from my head. There was nothing
left for me to do but to record their talk
in order to make my complaint perfectly
clear to your honorable board. This was
the conversation:</p>

<p>"Well, now, this says that Daniel Pingree
died at Marblehead in 1703. If that's
so, how under the sun, I'd like to know,
was he married to Pamela Perkins in
1706?"</p>

<p>"Why, it doesn't say that, does it?"</p>

<p>"Look for yourself. There it is. And
who was Pamela Pingree who died in
1689?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she was his great-aunt. I've got
her traced all clear enough. Her mother
was a Jimson. They lived in the old Jimson
homestead in Worcester. Her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was Zachariah Jimson, and he was my
ancestor; he was the third cousin of the
Earl of Dingleberry. I got into the 'Grand
Dames of the Pequot War,' and the
'United Order of American Descendants
of Third Cousins of Earls'&mdash;both of
them, through Zachariah. But that
doesn't explain how Molly Bixby, whose
mother came over in the Sarah Jane from
Bristol, and who settled at Cohasset in
1690, turned up in Philadelphia in 1775
married to an officer in the English army.
Then I am nearly distracted about Jabez
Whicher. He was an intimate friend of
Sir Harry Vane, and I don't see how I
can ever get into the 'Descendants of Persons
Who Were Acquainted With People
Worth While' unless I can find out something
about him."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there was such a man?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. My mother was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Whicher. I have been all through the
town history of Tinkleham, where he came
from. We have two samplers at home,
worked by his great-granddaughter. And
I have hunted in the genealogies of the
Diddleback family&mdash;he married a Diddleback,
my grandfather always said, and in
the genealogies of the Fritterleys and the
Nynkums, because they were the most
prominent families of Tinkleham."</p>

<p>"What have you got there?"</p>

<p>"This? Oh, this is the town and court
records of Footleboro'&mdash;it is only three
miles from Tinkleham, you know, and I
thought I might find out something about
him. Let me see, let me see&mdash;gracious,
what fine print! There, here are the
Whichers, lots of them. Andrew, Benjamin,
Charles&mdash;why, here he is! Victory
at last! 'Whicher, Jabez.' That's
the man! Now, page 719. Here we are!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
What's this&mdash;'Site of the Old Pump'?
Why, what's the matter with this index?
It says page 719 clear enough. And, look
here, isn't this page 719?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, it seems to be. I don't understand.
Oh, this is it&mdash;that means
paragraph 719. Look under that. There
you are. What? 'June 2d, 1659, Jabez
Whicher was accused before the justices
of stealing sundry fowl and swine from
several of the townsfolk, and he did plead
that he was guilty, and was fined twelve
pence, and sentenced to confinement in the
jail for one year, and to be branded with
the letter T on his right cheek.' Dear me,
is that your ancestor?"</p>

<p>"Why no, certainly not; how ridiculous!
Another person of the same name,
of course."</p>

<p>"But it is a very unusual name."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Whicher is a common name&mdash;I mean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that is&mdash;I mean&mdash;oh, of
course this is some one else."</p>

<p class="pbq p1">I cannot chronicle their conversation
any further. Enough has been given to
show you the nature of the annoyances to
which I was subjected yesterday. I look
to you, gentlemen, for relief.</p>

<p class="pnn8">Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">Obadiah Wurzberger</span>.<br /></p>

<p class="p1">To the Board of Directors of the Blankville
Public Library.</p>

<p>Gentlemen: I regret to hear from my
colleague, Dr. O. Wurzberger, that you
have denied his application for relief in
the matter of conversation within the
library alcoves. Dr. Wurzberger has
been unable to work for over a week on
account of the disturbing chatter that goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
on in the alcove next to his, and yet you
reply that conversation has always been
allowed there, and that you do not see
your way to forbidding it.</p>

<p>In order to show you that he is not
alone in finding this conversation disturbing,
I wish to state that I have been intolerably
annoyed. I have been trying to
work in the alcove on the other side of the
one where the talking occurs. The first
volume of my Arabic dictionary (on which
I have been engaged continuously since
1867) is soon to appear, and I had hoped
to devote a few weeks to a final revision.
But how much I was able to accomplish to-day,
for instance, you may see from this
clack and chatter which took place within
eight feet of me.</p>

<p>The first to begin, at half-past nine
o'clock, were two youths. This is a literal
account of what they said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"When is the exam?"</p>

<p>"September 22d."</p>

<p>"What in thunder are you beginning to
grind now for?"</p>

<p>"Why, we are going to start for Squid
Cove day after to-morrow, and we always
stay till after Labor Day. Of course I
shan't do any grinding down there; and
then when we get back Pete Brown and I
are going to take the car and go up to Lake
George for the rest of the month&mdash;or till
the exam, anyhow."</p>

<p>"So you've only got to-day and to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"Gee! What does the course cover?"</p>

<p>"English literature from Beowulf to
the death of Swinburne."</p>

<p>"Know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"Not a damned thing."</p>

<p>"Know who Beowulf was?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"No,&mdash;I thought you were going to
put me on to that."</p>

<p>"Well, you know who Swinburne was,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing; he wrote 'The Blessed
Damozel.'"</p>

<p>"Snappy work, old man. You came
pretty near it, anyhow. Only, don't put
that in the exam. You won't get asked
many questions about modern writers, so
don't worry over them. Perhaps you'll
get one on Tennyson. Don't say he lived
in the Craigie House on Brattle street, and
wrote 'Evangeline,' will you? Now, we
might as well open the book, and take a
chance anywhere. Here's Milton. Ever
hear of him?"</p>

<p>"John Milton, England's greatest epic
poet, was the son of a scrivener. He was
born in 1608 in Grub Street, London. He
lived there till he was sixteen, so it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that his youthful eyes may have
beheld Shakspeare, his only superior.
He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well! Where did you get all
this?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. Little did his worthy
parents realize that their son was destined
to write some of the most charming
lyrics, the most powerful sonnets, and
the greatest epic in the English language,
and to lose his sight in&mdash;in&mdash;oh!
I forget what he lost his sight in. But,
say, how is that? Learned it this morning,
while I was eating breakfast."</p>

<p>"Marvelous! But what was that about
Grub Street? This book says Bread
Street."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right&mdash;Bread Street.
Knew it was something about grub."</p>

<p>"Well, you better cut all that out about
the street. You might get mixed again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and put it Pudding Lane. It doesn't make
a hit, anyhow. They would rather have
some drool about his influence on literature,
or something of that sort. They'll
probably ask you to contrast 'L'Allegro'
with 'Il Penseroso,' or describe his attitude
toward the Presbyterians, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right&mdash;I'm there with the
goods. 'L'Allegro' describes the care-free
life of the happy man&mdash;the philosophy
falsely attributed to the followers of Epicurus,
which is summed up in the maxim,
'Eat, drink and be merry,' more completely
described in the Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam. 'Il Penseroso,' on the other
hand, is the thoughtful, sober student by
no means to be confounded with the melancholy
man, but, on the other hand&mdash;oh,
I've got that down cold&mdash;I can go on
that way for three pages."</p>

<p>"We'll let Milton alone, then. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
seem to know everything to be known
about him. How are you on Swift,
Addison and that crowd? They always
give you three or four questions about
them."</p>

<p>"I've got to read over what that book
says on that period. I am not very sure
whether Swift or Defoe wrote the 'Tatler,'
and those other things&mdash;they're all mixed
up in my mind, anyway."</p>

<p>"How about Shakspeare?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. No one knows when he was
born or died, what he did, or whether he
wrote his plays or not."</p>

<p>"You'll get in trouble if you say that.
I don't believe you will get any question
about him. Here's Jane Austen."</p>

<p>"She was the woman that was married
three or four times, and ought to have
been two or three other times, wasn't
she?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; you've mixed her with someone
else. You ought to be able to discuss
her style, and compare it with Charlotte
Bronte's. They're dippy about Jane out
there, so be sure and read her up. And
don't fail to express great admiration for
Spenser, if you get a chance."</p>

<p>"Was he the fellow who said we were
all descended from monkeys?"</p>

<p>"No, no. What are you talking about?
He was a poet&mdash;time of Shakspeare, or
about then. You ought to read some of
him. Read some of 'The Shepherd's Calendar'
and quote from it. You'll hate it,
but it will work a great swipe with the
examiner."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have to go along now.
Mighty good of you to put me on to these
points."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it."</p>

<p>"Let's see&mdash;Swift, Jane Austen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Spenser are the ducks you say I ought
to look up?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and Addison and Marlowe.
And say, find out something about Wordsworth.
They'll ask about his attitude
toward the French Revolution, or some
damfool thing like that."</p>

<p>"All right, I will. What was his attitude
toward it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I had it all down fine
once&mdash;when I took that exam. He liked
it or else he didn't, I forget which.
But say, you want to know a little about
Dryden and Pope, too."</p>

<p>"Dryden and Pope. All right, I got
'em on my list. I'll be able to write three
pages about both of 'em before I go to
bed. So long!"</p>

<p>"So long!"</p>


<p class="p2">They parted; but the alcove was empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
only three minutes. It was then occupied
by a man and a woman. The woman
began the conversation.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brooks said I certainly ought to
consult you, Mr. Wigglesworth. She said
your knowledge of local history will be
indispensable to us."</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder if I understand you
correctly. You and the other ladies of
your club wish to give a pageant, illustrating
past events in the history of the
town?"</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly. Now, we thought
it would be so nice if we could have the
visit of Lafayette to Blankville, for one
thing. I am to be the Marquise de Lafayette,
in a Louis Quinze gown and
powdered hair."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. And your husband, I presume,
will represent the marquis?"</p>

<p>"Daniel? Oh dear, no. Mr. Jones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
would never take any interest in it. He
is so busy, you know. Dr. Peabody will
be Lafayette."</p>

<p>"I see. Dr. Peabody will be Lafayette.
I suppose, of course, that you wish to
carry out the pageant with due regard for
historical accuracy, correctness of costume,
and all that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Certainly! That is what will
make it so charming, and interesting, and
picturesque, and er&mdash;er&mdash;educational.
Dr. Peabody has picked out his costume already.
He has spent hours over it. It
is all white satin, high-heeled shoes, a
jeweled sword, and a powdered wig. We
thought we would represent the ball given
to the marquis and marchioness by the
leading citizens of the town. Then we
could have a minuet, you know. Dr.
Peabody dances so beautifully."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. I see only one objection to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
this. From the point of view of historical
truth, I mean. Lafayette did not visit
Blankville on his first sojourn in this
country."</p>

<p>"Oh, would that make any difference?"</p>

<p>"Well, it would, rather."</p>

<p>"I don't see why."</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, when he did come
here he was an old man. He was about
old enough to be Dr. Peabody's grandfather,
I should judge."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Furthermore, there was no ball given
by the leading citizens, and no minuet."</p>

<p>"But there must have been something!"</p>

<p>"There was. The selectmen gathered
at the post-house and presented an address
of welcome."</p>

<p>"Well, why couldn't we have that?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly you could. But it occurred
at about nine o'clock on a rainy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
night. Lafayette did not alight from his
coach, for he was trying to get on to
Fairfield that night. He was suffering
from a headache, and not only had on a
nightcap, but had his head swathed in
flannel bandages as well. He merely put
out his head for a moment from the coach
window, took the address, thanked the
selectmen and immediately retired from
view. There is no doubt at all about
this, for Abner Willcox, the first historian
of Blankville, was one of the
selectmen."</p>

<p>"I don't see how we could have that
very well."</p>

<p>"It is possible that you could persuade
Dr. Peabody to appear in a nightcap and
flannel bandages, but from what I know of
the young man I should think it extremely
doubtful."</p>

<p>"Well, it would not be picturesque!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Possibly not; but it would be historically
correct, which is even better."</p>

<p>"I do not think so. I do not believe that
a pageant should follow the facts of history
slavishly. The object is to reproduce in a
beautiful manner the events of the past."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, Mrs. Jones. I have no objection
to the beauty of the spectacle, but
if the Historical Association, whose president
and representative I am, are to contribute
toward the pageant, I must insist
upon some regard for historical truth."</p>

<p>"Well, what could we have? Are there
not some events that would be suitable?
Did not General Washington and Mrs.
Washington visit our town?"</p>

<p>"They did not. They seem to have
overlooked it."</p>

<p>"Was there never an Indian raid?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there was. In 1641."</p>

<p>"How would that do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will leave you to judge. The Indians&mdash;there
were three of them&mdash;were all intoxicated.
They endeavored to steal a
horse, but were discovered by a servant
girl of one Enoch Winslow, who owned
the horse. She locked them up in the
barn until the constable could come and
take them to the village jail."</p>

<p>"It does not sound very dramatic."</p>

<p>"I am no judge of what is or is not
dramatic, Mrs. Jones. I merely give you
the facts. Possibly you might like to represent
the landing of the first settlers."</p>

<p>"Yes; that sounds delightful."</p>

<p>"It was not a delightful occasion for the
settlers. It is a matter of record that on
landing they were instantly attacked by
mosquitoes in such large numbers that
they had to beat a hasty retreat to their
ship."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we could have that and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
out the mosquitoes,&mdash;it would be hard to
have them, anyway."</p>

<p>"That would be impossible, madam.
The modern school of history, of which
I am a follower, allows the omission of no
detail which makes for accuracy. Perhaps
you would not be able to introduce the mosquitoes,
though it might be managed. If
not, I should insist that the persons representing
the settlers beat their arms and
hands about, and retreat to the vessel in
evident distress."</p>

<p>"It does seem hard to find anything. I
must go now. I hope you will think it over,
Mr. Wigglesworth. Good morning."</p>

<p class="pbq p1">These, gentlemen of the board, were the
annoyances I suffered to-day. Can you do
nothing to remedy this state of things?</p>

<p class="pc2 large">THE LITERARY ZOO</p>

<p class="pn2">"The idea is not exactly original," I
complained.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," Mr. Gooch replied, "at
least, perhaps it isn't wholly original in a
general sense. Still, disregarding what
private collectors may have done, I am
sure this is the first public library to establish
a literary-zoölogical annex on so
extensive a scale. We aim at nothing less
than completeness."</p>

<p>"Oh! that is what you call it&mdash;a literary-zoölogical
annex? I thought I had
heard it called a literary zoo."</p>

<p>"We think the other name a little
more dignified. That is what it will be
termed on the invitations. Let me see;
I believe I sent you an advance invitation?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
They are not to be issued till next
Monday."</p>

<p>He had sent me one, and I took it from
my pocket and read it over again.</p>

<p>"The Public Library of East Caraway,"
it said, "requests the honor of your
presence at the opening of its Literary-Zoölogical
Annex, Thursday, September
1st, at ten o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>"</p>

<p>"We have to set that hour," Mr. Gooch
explained, "because the animals are so
much brighter then. In the afternoon they
get sleepy, and at four o'clock, which is
feeding time, they are noisy and quarrelsome.
But come, we will go and inspect
them."</p>

<p>He rose and led the way out of his
office. We went through the delivery
room, where a dozen or twenty people were
waiting for books, and out through the
stacks to the door of the big wooden annex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Mr. Gooch drew a bunch of keys
from his pocket and unfastened the
padlock.</p>

<p>"Of course you understand," said he,
as he pushed back the heavy doors, "there
are still very many empty cages. Our
collection is about one-fifth what we hope
to have in two years. It is slow work,
and most of the specimens are obtained
only after long research and difficult negotiation.
Some owners of the most desirable
animals hold them at prices absolutely
prohibitive to a library like ours.
I could tell you of haggling and bargaining
that we have done! Well, you would
never believe, for instance, what the owner
of the horse who brought the news from
Ghent to Aix wants for him, and as for
Circe's swine&mdash;there are only two of
them extant now&mdash;they might be made
of pure gold, those pigs! But we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
enough animals to make a respectable
showing on opening day, I think, and I
believe the collection will be decidedly
educational in its effects."</p>

<p>Mr. Gooch has a firmer trust in the
educational value of many things than I
have been able to share, but I looked forward
with great interest to this first view
of his animals.</p>

<p>"This section is devoted to birds," said
Mr. Gooch; "that swan floating around
on the pool is the one who was once an ugly
duckling; the cockatoo on the perch belonged
to Count Fosco; and the red bird
is, of course, the Kentucky Cardinal.</p>

<p>"One moment," I interposed, "how
do you classify your animals? Not by
authors, I take it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gooch looked a little embarrassed.
"Well, no," he admitted; "it
was a very painful thing, for as a librarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
I naturally wished to do everything
according to library methods. But it was
absolutely impossible. We tried it, and
we had some harrowing experiences."</p>

<p>Mr. Gooch wiped his brow with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"The Kipling section was a perfect
pandemonium in no time," he went on,
"there was a terrific battle between the
tiger and one of the elephants. I thought
the whole place would be torn to pieces.
We got them separated somehow, and we
saw then that it would be utterly impossible
to classify by authors. In some cases it
might be done, but we had to stick to one
system or another, so we adopted the usual
methods of the zoölogical museums&mdash;the
birds by themselves, the carnivora together,
and so on. It is hardly scholarly,
I know, but we had to do it."</p>

<p>I could not deny that he had acted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the best. By way of changing the subject
I asked him about a small bird of inconspicuous
appearance.</p>

<p>"It is the nightingale that inspired
John Keats," he replied, "he sings sometimes,
on moonlit nights. I can tell you,
however, that the Ode is better than his
song. The raven, sitting there on the
pallid bust of Pallas, you will recognize
without any difficulty. This other
raven&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Belonged to Barnaby Rudge, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>he</i> is owned by a private collector.
This one flew and croaked ahead of Queen
Guinevere, when she fled all night long
by glimmering waste and weald, and
heard the spirits of the waste and weald
moan as she fled. Our ravens are not
very cheerful birds. The other large, black
bird is Solomon Caw, who lived in Kensington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Gardens. There at the edge of
the pool stands the Caliph Stork."</p>

<p>"And this hen?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That is Em'ly, who was once the object
of attention from a Virginian. The
other is the Little Red Hin."</p>

<p>"You will be able to make an addition
to your poultry soon," I remarked.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, one Chantecler."</p>

<p>"Will we? I don't know. We don't
go in for every animal that becomes notorious
through advertising. Do you recognize
the canary?"</p>

<p>"Little Nell's?"</p>

<p>"No, this one hung in the cabin of the
brig Flying Scud. Here are the dogs&mdash;well
penned, you see&mdash;I didn't intend
that outrageous pun&mdash;because some of
them are dangerous. This is Wolf, who
once belonged to Rip Van Winkle. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
persons have the impression that his name
is Snider. The bloodhound is one of those
which pursued Eliza across the ice. There
are many impostors, but our specimen is
undoubtedly genuine."</p>

<p>"And the stuffed bloodhound?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"He was shot with a bottle of Daffy's
Elixir by Micah Clarke. The other stuffed
dog, that gigantic black one, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Hound of the Baskervilles, of
course!" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Certainly; there are the marks of
Sherlock Holmes's bullets. This fox terrier,
who is so lively and amiable, is Montmorency,
who once went on a trip with
Three Men in a Boat. This stuffed pug,
who looks flattened and damaged, is Willoughby,
who was killed by having a Fallen
Idol tumble on him. The enormous St.
Bernard is Porthos, who belonged to Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Ibbetson, and that collie once had the
extreme honor of being chased about
in the snow and caught by Mr. Van
Bibber."</p>

<p>We walked on, down the long passage,
with cages on either side. On shelves,
here and there, were animals, dead and
stuffed. It had been impossible to procure
them alive. Mr. Gooch pointed out a fox,
who plainly had been cut in two. The
stitches where the taxidermist sewed him
together were easy to see. It was the fox,
so the librarian told me, killed in Spain by
the Brigadier Gerard.</p>

<p>"Here are the cats," announced Mr.
Gooch, "and their characters vary. The
Persian kitten, who is chasing her tail, has
been celebrated in Rubaiyat. That large
Tom is not named Tom, but Peter. He
once had some painkiller administered to
him by Tom Sawyer. The disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
looking creature belonged to Mr. Wilde,
the repairer of reputations in 'The King
in Yellow.' Perhaps you recognize the
other?"</p>

<p>"It must be The Black Cat!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," said Mr. Gooch. "Before
we look at the horses, I want you to
come into this little room. The collection
here is unique&mdash;it cannot be approached
by any other in the world. This large
cage is intended for the Jabberwock&mdash;when
we obtain him. In the meanwhile
here are some Mome Raths&mdash;a sort of
green pig who has lost his way, you know;
two Borogoves and a Slithy Tove."</p>

<p>I gazed with feelings of deep emotion
on the Slithy Tove&mdash;"something like a
badger, something like a lizard, and something
like a corkscrew." The two Borogoves,
who were both very mimsy indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
did not belie their reputation for looking
like live mops.</p>

<p>"This room is admirable! Have you
any other animals in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Gooch replied, "here is the
Pobble Who Has No Toes."</p>

<p>"The genuine Pobble?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely genuine. The veritable
Pobble who went to fish for his Aunt
Jobiska's runcible cat with crimson whiskers.
Over there you can see the Griffin
who once carried a Minor Canon on his
back. And beside him&mdash;"</p>

<p>I saw a large and sulky-looking bird,
seated in a chair, in a state of deep dejection
and invalidism. His head was tied
up, as if he were very ill.</p>

<p>"Surely that is The Cockalorum."</p>

<p>Mr. Gooch nodded.</p>

<p>"Follow me, please. This room&mdash;" he
opened a door that led into what seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to be a vast and absolutely empty apartment&mdash;"this
room contains a Snark, and
the Invisible Dog who figured in the
Stories of Three Burglars. Beyond are
some of the animals who once lived on
a certain island with one Dr. Moreau.
Would you like to see them?"</p>

<p>I shuddered and declined.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. We will return to
the main building."</p>

<p>We did so, and the librarian paused beside
a small case. "Here is The Gold Bug.
This caterpillar is the one that Sergeant
Troy removed on the tip of his sword from
the dress of Bathsheba Everdene. And
the bees were of the swarm that traveled
about with the Bee Man of Orn."</p>

<p>The two cages beyond both contained
large apes.</p>

<p>"Our orang-outangs," remarked Mr.
Gooch, "have decidedly bad reputations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
The one on the right committed the murders
in the Rue Morgue. The other is
called Bimi&mdash;he belonged to a Frenchman
named Bertran. The next cage has
a miscellaneous assortment of Bander
Log. Oh! here are some horses and
cattle. The pony once belonged to Tom
Bailey. This donkey was one of those
which used to annoy Miss Betsy Trotwood.
Priscilla Alden, on her wedding-day, rode
on this white bull. The stuffed donkey is
the one whose dead body lay once in the
pathway of a traveler on a Sentimental
Journey. And the other donkey was the
foster-mother of the Luck of Roaring
Camp."</p>

<p>I pointed to some enormous and repulsive-looking
crabs that were crawling
about on the sand at the edge of a tank,
and asked what they were. The librarian
told me that they were from the subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
river over which Allan Quatermain
and his friends traveled.</p>

<p>"But they," said Mr. Gooch, "are
nothing to the fellow in the next tank."</p>

<p>I looked where he indicated and saw the
most hideous monster it has ever been my
bad luck to come across. It was a tremendous
crab&mdash;the creature of a nightmare.</p>

<p>"It is one of those found on the shores
of the Future by the traveler who voyaged
on the Time Machine."</p>

<p>"I think I have had enough of your
aquariums," I said.</p>

<p>"Just look at this. Here is the Jumping
Frog of Calaveras County, whose name
was Daniel Webster. He has recovered
from his meal of birdshot, and can jump
surprisingly. Oh! and over there is the
Crocodile who swallowed an alarm clock."</p>

<p>Mr. Gooch stopped before a row of elephants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
who were swaying about, eating
hay, and requesting peanuts. I was shown
Moti Guj, the mutineer, and the elephant
on whose back Private Mulvaney once
went for a ride. There was also Zenobia,
who fell in love with a country doctor, and
Her Ladyship's Elephant.</p>

<p>There were a number of tigers, including,
of course, the ill-natured Shere Khan.</p>

<p>"The one in the second cage," said my
guide, "is one of those hunted by Mr.
Isaacs, when he was after a tiger-skin to
present to Miss Westonhaugh."</p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting of all
was one which, so Mr. Gooch told me,
had been confined in a cage beside a lady's
apartment, to await the opening of a door
by a young man. But Mr. Gooch was unable
to tell me whether the man opened
the door of the Lady or the Tiger.</p>

<p>Among the lions I saw the beast which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
fought with a crocodile in the presence of
Leo Vincey and Horace Holly. A black
panther was recognizable as Bagheera, and
another, of the normal color, was the same
animal who conceived a passion for a
French soldier in the desert.</p>

<p>"Here are some smaller animals," said
Mr. Gooch; "do you know this fellow
with the sharp nose?"</p>

<p>"It is a mongoose, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Rikki-tikki-tavi, himself. And
these white mice belonged to Count Fosco,
like the cockatoo. This mouse, alone by
herself, was the pet of Barty Josselin."</p>

<p>We moved on, but I began to look at
my watch, for I had a train to catch.</p>

<p>"The snakes are an especially fine part
of the collection," Mr. Gooch remarked;
"do you see this swamp adder? It is the
Speckled Band, that gave Sherlock Holmes
an uncomfortable five minutes. That little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
coral snake in the pickle bottle was responsible
for the death of one Reingelder.
The two rattlesnakes were intimates of
Elsie Venner, and in that cage you may
see Kaa, the great rock python. But here
is a greater prize than any."</p>

<p>He indicated an extraordinary and
beautiful serpent, at which I looked with
the greatest surprise and wonder.</p>

<p class="ppi p1">"She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,</p>
<p class="ppi">Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue;</p>
<p class="ppi">Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,</p>
<p class="ppi">Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barred;</p>
<p class="ppi">And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed,</p>
<p class="ppi">Dissolved, or brighter shone, or inter-wreathed</p>
<p class="ppi">Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppi">So rainbow-sided, touched with miseries,</p>
<p class="ppi">She seemed, at once, some penanced lady elf,</p>
<p class="ppi">Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self.</p>
<p class="ppi">Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire</p>
<p class="ppi">Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne's tiar;</p>
<p class="ppi">Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet!</p>
<p class="ppi">She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">"That," said the librarian, "I consider
the gem of the collection."</p>

<p>"It is truly," I replied, "but I think it
a profanation to have poor Lamia here."</p>

<p>"You don't consider&mdash;" began Mr.
Gooch.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. And I must hurry now,
for it is nearly train time. I am deeply
indebted to you for this sight of your animals,
and I hope your opening day will be
a great success. It is my advice to you
not to let any nervous persons see those
crabs, though."</p>

<p>"Just a minute. We have a rhinoceros
here, who got cake-crumbs inside his skin.
His name is Strorks, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you very much; but I really
must hurry. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p>And I went out and left him beside the
rhinoceros.</p>

<p class="pc2 large">THEIR JUST REWARD</p>

<p class="pn2">I looked and beheld, and there were
a vast number of girls standing in rows.
Many of them wore pigtails, and most of
them chewed gum.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" I asked my guide.</p>

<p>And he said: "They are the girls who
wrote 'Lovely' or 'Perfectly sweet' or
'Horrid old thing!' on the fly-leaves of
library books. Some of them used to put
comments on the margins of the pages&mdash;such
as 'Served him right!' or 'There!
you mean old cat!'"</p>

<p>"What will happen to them?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"They are to stand up to the neck in a
lake of ice cream soda for ten years," he
answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will not be much of a punishment
to them," I suggested.</p>

<p>But he told me that I had never tried it,
and I could not dispute him.</p>

<p>"The ones over there," he remarked,
pointing to a detachment of the girls who
were chewing gum more vigorously than
the others, "are sentenced for fifteen years
in the ice cream soda lake, and moreover
they will have hot molasses candy dropped
on them at intervals. They are the ones
who wrote:</p>

<p class="ppn4 p1">If my name you wish to see<br />

<p class="pn1">and so on, and so on, until you were ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to drop from weariness and exasperation.
Hang me!" he suddenly exploded, "if
I had the say of it, I'd bury 'em alive in
cocoanut taffy&mdash;I told the Boss so,
myself."</p>

<p>I agreed with him that they were getting
off easy.</p>

<p>"A lot of them are named 'Gerty,' too,"
he added, as though that made matters
worse.</p>

<p>Then he showed me a great crowd of
older people. They were mostly men,
though there were one or two women
here and there.</p>

<p>"These are the annotators," he said,
"the people who work off their idiotic
opinions on the margins and fly-leaves of
books. They dispute the author's statements,
call him a liar and abuse him generally.
The one on the end used to get all the
biographies of Shakespeare he could find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and cover every bit of blank paper in them
with pencil-writing signed 'A Baconian.'
He usually began with the statement:
'The author of this book is a pig-headed
fool.' The man next to him believed that
the earth is flat, and he aired that theory
so extensively with a fountain-pen that
he ruined about two hundred dollars' worth
of books. They caught him and put him
in jail for six months, but he will have to
take his medicine here just the same.
There are two religious cranks standing
just behind him. At least, they were
cranks about religion. One of them was
an atheist and he used to write blasphemy
all over religious books. The other suffered
from too much religion. He would
jot down texts and pious mottoes in every
book he got hold of. He would cross out,
or scratch out all the oaths and cuss words
in a book; draw a pencil line through any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
reference to wine, or strong drink, and call
especial attention to any passage or phrase
he thought improper by scrawling over it.
He is tied to the atheist, you notice. The
woman in the second row used to write
'How true!' after any passage or sentence
that pleased her. She gets only six years.
Most of the others will have to keep it up
for eight."</p>

<p>"Keep what up?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Climbing barbed-wire fences," was the
answer; "they don't have to hurry, but
they must keep moving. They begin to-morrow
at half-past seven."</p>

<p>We walked down the hill toward a group
of infamous looking people. My guide
stopped and pointed toward them.</p>

<p>"These are snippers, cutters, clippers,
gougers and extra-illustrators. They
vary all the way from men who cut 'want
ads' out of the newspapers in the reading-rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to those who go into the alcoves
and lift valuable plates by the wet-string
method. You see they come from all
classes of society&mdash;and there are men and
women, girls and boys. You notice they
are all a little round-shouldered, and they
keep glancing suspiciously right and left.
This is because they got into the habit of
sinking down in their chairs to get behind
a newspaper, and watching to see if anyone
was looking. There is one man who
was interested in heraldry. He extended
his operations over five or six libraries,
public and private. When they found him
out and visited his room it looked like the
College of Heralds. He had a couple of
years in prison, but here he is now, just the
same. The man next to him is&mdash;well, no
need to mention names,&mdash;you recognize
him. Famous millionaire and politician.
Never went into a library but once in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
life. Then he went to see an article in a
London newspaper, decided he wanted to
keep it, and tore out half the page. Library
attendant saw him, called a policeman,
and tried to have him arrested. You
see, the attendant didn't know who he
was."</p>

<p>"Did anything come of it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the guide, "there did.
The library attendant was discharged.
Blank simply told the Board of Trustees
that he had been insulted by a whippersnapper
who didn't look as if he had ever
had a square meal in his life. One or two
of the board wanted to investigate, but
the majority would have jumped through
hoops if Blank had told them to. He is in
this section for five years, but he has over
eight hundred to work off in other departments.
The men on the end of the line,
five or six dozen of them, used to cut plates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
out of the art magazines&mdash;a common
habit. Woman standing next, used to steal
sermons. Man next but one to her was a
minister. He was writing a book on the
Holy Land, and he cut maps out of every
atlas in a library. Said he didn't mean
to keep them long."</p>

<p>This group interested me, and I
wondered what was to be done with
them.</p>

<p>"You will see in a minute," said the
guide; "they are going to begin work
right away."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a number of officials came
down the hill with enormous sheets of
sticky fly-paper. These were distributed
among the "snippers, cutters, clippers,
gougers and extra-illustrators," who thereupon
set to work with penknives, cutting
small bits out of the fly-paper. In a few
minutes the wretched creatures were covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
from head to foot with pieces of the
horrible stuff; pulling it off one hand to
have it stick on the other, getting it in their
hair, on their eyebrows, and plastering
themselves completely.</p>

<p>"That is not very painful," I observed.</p>

<p>"No," said my companion, "perhaps
not. Gets somewhat monotonous after
four years, though. Come over to the end
of this valley. I want you to see a dinner
party that is taking place."</p>

<p>We left the sticky fly-paper folks behind
us, and proceeded through the valley. On
the side of the hill I noticed a small body
of people, mostly men.</p>

<p>The guide pointed over his shoulder at
them, remarking: "Reformed Spellers."</p>

<p>They were busily engaged in clipping
one another's ears off with large scissors.
There was a sign on the hill beside them.
It read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">ears are unnecessary. why not get
rid of them? leave enuf to hear
with. don't stop til you are thru.</span></p>

<p>At the end of the valley there was a large
level space. Something like a picnic was
going on. People were eating at hundreds
of little tables, and some were dancing, or
strolling about on the grass. The guide
stopped.</p>

<p>"The Boss is prouder of this than of
anything else in the whole place," he said.
"The people who are giving this party are
the genealogists. Nearly all women, you
notice. These are the folks who have
driven librarians to profanity and gray
hairs. Some of them wanted ancestors for
public and social reasons; some of them
for historical or financial purposes; some
merely to gratify personal pride or private
curiosity. But they all wanted ancestors
for one reason or another, and ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
they <i>would</i> have. For years they charged
into libraries demanding ancestors. Over
there, you see that big crowd? They are
the two hundred and fifty thousand lineal
descendants of William Brewster. Next
to them are six thousand rightful Lords
Baltimore. That vast mob beginning at
the big tree, and extending for six miles to
the northeast are the John Smith and Pocahontas
crowd&mdash;some descended from one
and some from the other&mdash;we haven't
got them sorted out yet."</p>

<p>"How many of them are there?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"According to our best estimates," he
replied, "in the neighborhood of eight
million at present; but of course we are
receiving fresh additions all the time.
Thirty-five hundred came in last month.
There is no time to count them, however."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>I laughed at this.</p>

<p>"Time!" I exclaimed, "why, you've
got eternity!"</p>

<p>But he merely waved his hand and
went on.</p>

<p>"They are the largest crowd here, anyway,
with the possible exception of the
Mayflower descendants. They have a
whole valley to themselves, beyond the second
hill. Some say there are twelve million
of them, but no one knows. Recently they
applied for another valley, for theirs is
full. You see it is so thickly planted with
family trees that they have to live in deep
shade all the time, and it is very damp and
chilly. Then there are upwards of three
hundred thousand tons of grandfather's
clocks, brass warming-pans, cradles, chairs
and tables, so they hardly can find standing
room."</p>

<p>We walked down amongst the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
who were giving the picnic. I wanted to
see what was the object of this lawn party,
for it struck me that it looked more like the
Elysian Fields than any other place.</p>

<p>I soon discovered my mistake. Near the
first group of tables was a sign with the
inscription: "Grand Dames of the Pequot
War," and at one of the tables sat Mrs.
Cornelia Crumpet. I remembered the
hours I had spent hunting up two ancestors
to enable Mrs. Crumpet to join the Grand
Dames. I had found them at last, and so,
apparently, had Mrs. Crumpet, for there
could be no doubt that the pair of sorry-looking
rascals whom she was entertaining
at luncheon were the long-lost ancestors.
One of them was the most completely soiled
individual I have ever seen. He was eating
something or other, and he did not waste
time with forks or any other implements.
The other had finished his meal, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
leaning negligently back in his chair. He
was smoking a large pipe, and he had
his feet on the table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crumpet wore an expression that
showed that her past desire to discover
these ancestors was as a passing whim,
compared with her present deep, overpowering
anxiety to be rid of them. I felt
sorry for the poor lady; but she was not
alone in her misery. All about her were
Grand Dames of the Pequot War, engaged
in entertaining their ancestors. Some of
the ancestors were more agreeable, some
far more distasteful to their descendants
than Mrs. Crumpet's pair. None of the
Grand Dames seemed to be having what
could be called a jolly time.</p>

<p>My guide at last led me through the
maze of tables and out into the open.</p>

<p>"We have a good many Japanese visitors
in this section," said he. "They come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to get some points from the Americans on
ancestor-worship."</p>

<p>"What do they say?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"They just giggle and go away," he
replied.</p>

<p>Beyond the genealogists we found a
large group of people, who, the guide
said, were the persons who borrow books
and never return them. The complainants,
in their case, were mainly private individuals
rather than public libraries.</p>

<p>"They are not particularly interesting,"
remarked the guide, "but their punishment
will appeal to you."</p>

<p>As we passed them I shuddered to see
that they were all engaged in filing catalogue
cards in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>"How long do they have to keep that
up?" was my question, and I was horrified
to learn that the terms varied from twenty
to thirty-five years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, that is the most damnable thing
I ever heard," I said&mdash;"the sticky fly-paper
folks were nothing to this!"</p>

<p>The guide shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"It's
the rule," he said.</p>

<p>The next lot of people we came on were
curiously engaged. Long lines of bookshelves
were set up about them, and they
wandered up and down, forever taking a
book from the shelf, only to sigh and put it
back again. As we came amongst them I
could see the cause of their weariness.
The shelves seemed to be lined with the
most brilliant looking books in handsome
bindings. They were lettered in gold:
"Complete Works of Charles Dickens,"
"Works of Dumas, Edition de Luxe,"
"Works of Scott," and so on. Yet when I
took one of the books in my hand to look
at it, it was no book at all, but just a
wooden dummy, painted on the back, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
absolutely blank everywhere else. They
were like the things used by furniture
dealers to put in a bookcase to make it look
as if it were full of books, or those used on
the stage, when a library setting is required.
There were many cords of wood,
but there was not a real book in any of the
cases.</p>

<p>I asked one of the sufferers why he was
doing this, and he stopped for a moment
his patrol, and turned his weary eyes upon
me.</p>

<p>"We are all alike," he said, indicating
his associates. "We are the literary
bluffers. Most of us were rich&mdash;I was,
myself," and he groaned heavily. "We
bought books by the yard&mdash;expensive
ones, always&mdash;editions de luxe, limited
editions&mdash;limited to ten thousand sets
and each set numbered, of which this is
No. 94," he added in a dull, mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
fashion, as though he were repeating a
lesson. "We were easy marks for all the
dealers and agents. Especially illustrated
editions, with extra copies of the engravings
in a portfolio; bindings in white kid,
or any other tomfool nonsense was what
we were always looking for. And they
saw that we got them. Whispered information
that this set of Paul de Kock or
Balzac was complete and unexpurgated,
and that if we would buy it for $125, the
publishers would throw in an extra
volume, privately printed, and given away
to purchasers, since it was against the law
to sell it&mdash;this was the sort of bait we
always bit at&mdash;cheerily! And now here
we are!"</p>

<p>And he began again his tramp up and
down, taking down the wooden dummies
and putting them back again, with dolorous
groans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>I could not stand this dismal spectacle
very long, so we hurried on to a crowd of
men bent nearly double over desks. They
were pale and emaciated, which my guide
told me was due to the fact that they had
nothing to eat but paper.</p>

<p>"They are bibliomaniacs," he exclaimed,
"collectors of unopened copies, seekers
after misprints, measurers by the millimetre
of the height of books. They are
kept busy here reading the Seaside novels
in paper covers. Next to them are the
bibliographers&mdash;compilers of lists and
counters of fly leaves. They cared more
for a list of books than for books themselves,
and they searched out unimportant
errors in books and rejoiced mightily
when they found one. Exactitude was
their god, so here we let them split hairs
with a razor and dissect the legs of fleas."</p>

<p>In a large troop of school children&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
few hundred yards beyond, I came across
a boy about fifteen years old. I seemed to
know him. When he came nearer he
proved to have two books tied around his
neck. The sickly, yellowish-brown covers
of them were disgustingly familiar to me&mdash;somebody's
geometry and somebody
else's algebra. The boy was blubbering
when he got up to me, and the sight of him
with those noxious books around his
neck made me sob aloud. I was still
crying when I awoke.</p>

<p class="pc2 large">THE CROWDED HOUR</p>

<p class="pbqn p2">(Scene: The Circulating Department of the&mdash;&mdash;Public
Library. Time: Four o'clock of a Saturday
afternoon in the winter. Miss Randlett and Miss
Vanderpyl, library assistants, are taking in books returned,
and issuing others to a group of persons, varying
in number from ten to fifty. The group includes
men and women, youths and maidens,&mdash;a number
of high-school students being conspicuous. Edgar,
Alfred, and Dan&mdash;library pages&mdash;going forward
and back from the desk to the book-stack, fetching
books called for. Sometimes they bring only the
call-slips with the word "OUT" stamped thereon. A
sign on the desk bears the inscription: "Please look up
the call numbers of any books that you wish in the
card catalogue. Write the numbers on a call-slip, and
present the slip at this desk." About fifty per cent of
the people pay no attention whatever to the sign.)</p>


<p class="p1">A small man in a large ulster, addressing
Miss Vanderpyl, in honeyed
tones: "Oh, pardon me! Have you
'The Blandishments of Belinda' in this
library?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss V. (working with both hands at
once, charging books, and trying to keep
thirty-seven people from becoming impatient):
"Er&mdash;I&mdash;am not sure. Who
is the author?"</p>

<p>The small man (bowing gracefully, with
the tips of his fingers on his heart): "I,
who now address you, Madam."</p>

<p>Miss V. (after wondering vainly what
light this answer throws on her difficulty,
and seeking for a reply which shall not
seem impertinent): "I really am not
sure,&mdash;probably we have it. Would
you mind looking it up in the catalogue,
please?"</p>

<p>The small man: "I beg pardon?"</p>

<p>Miss V. (indicating): "In the catalogue,&mdash;over
there."</p>

<p>The small man: "Oh, those <i>horrid</i>
cards? Dear me! I would never think
of entangling myself in their <i>dreadful</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
meshes! I fear I might never survive it,
you know. Is there no other way? Ah,
red tape! red tape!"</p>

<p>(He hovers about for an instant, and
then flits away.)</p>

<p>A very large woman, with an armful of
bundles (depositing six books on the desk
with a crash, and heaving a sigh that scatters
the call-slips and memoranda right and
left): "<i>There!</i> If my arms ain't nearly
fallin' off! Say, you oughta give shawlstraps
to carry these books with. Now,
here's 'The Life Beautiful,'&mdash;I wanta
return that, and 'The Romance of Two
Worlds' an' 'Cometh up as a Flower,'&mdash;why,
no, it ain't either,&mdash;it's 'Family
Hymns'&mdash;if I ain't gone and picked that
up off the settin'-room table and lugged it
all this way, an' I <i>told</i> Hattie to keep her
hands off them books,&mdash;well, I'll put it
back in my bag&mdash;here, young man! you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>

the liberry. Now, here's this, an' this, an'
I want this swapped onto this card, an' this
one I want renood an' I wanta get 'Airy,
Fairy Lilian' an'&mdash;oh, Lord! there goes
my macaroni onto the floor,&mdash;all smashed
to smithereens, I s'pose&mdash;no, 't ain't,
either,&mdash;thank you, young man! Now, if
you'll just&mdash;"</p>

<p>A high school student: "Can I get a
copy of 'The Merchant of Venice,' the
Rolfe edition?"</p>

<p>The very large woman: "Now, just
you wait a minute, young feller! One at
a time, here!"</p>

<p>Miss V. (at last making herself heard):
"These books which you want to return
should go over to <i>that</i> desk."</p>

<p>The very large woman: "What? Oh,
Lord, I forgot! That's so, ain't it? Well,
I'll take 'em over, but say, jus' let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
leave my bundles here a minute&mdash;I'll be
right back."</p>

<p>(She departs, leaving a package of
macaroni, two dozen eggs, and a black
string bag to help cover the already
crowded desk.)</p>

<p>An old gentleman (holding a call-slip in
both hands, and looking at Miss V. over
his eye-glasses): "This says that President
Lowell's book on the government of
England is 'out.' Do you mean to say
that you own only <i>one</i> copy of such an
important work?"</p>

<p>Edgar: "No, sir, we got two, but
they're all out."</p>

<p>The old gentleman: "Well, two, then!
Why, I daresay you have half a dozen of
some trashy novel or other. Why, do you
know that the author is President of
Harvard University?"</p>

<p>Edgar (quite cheerfully): "No, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman: "Well, he is! Your
librarian ought to be told of this. Where
is he? I shall enter a complaint."</p>

<p>A woman with poppies on her hat:
"How do you do, Miss Vanderpyl?
You're looking so well! You've <i>quite</i>
recovered from that dreadful illness you
had last fall? I'm so glad! Now, I've
brought you something."</p>

<p>(She extends an envelope, which Miss
V., who has a book in one hand, and a
combination pencil and dating-stamp in
the other, takes between the last two
fingers of her right hand.)</p>

<p>The woman with poppies: "Those are
two tickets for the reception that is going
to be given this evening by the Grand
Dames of the Pequot War. It's <i>very</i> exclusive,
and the tickets are awfully hard
to get. I felt sure you'd like to go and
take a friend. They are not giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
tickets away to everyone, I can assure you.
Oh, isn't that 'The Long Roll' over there
on that desk? I do so want to read that,
and they say there isn't a single copy in,
except that one. You'll just let me take
it, won't you?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Why, I'm awfully sorry!
That copy is reserved for someone,&mdash;she
paid for the post-card notice, you know,
and we've written her that the book is
here. I'm very sorry!"</p>

<p>The woman with poppies: "Oh, is that
so?"</p>

<p>(She reaches over, and deftly withdraws
the envelope from Miss V.'s fingers, and
replaces it in her card-case. Then she
speaks again:)</p>

<p>"I am so sorry. Perhaps you won't
be able to go to the reception this evening,
anyhow. Good afternoon, Miss
Vanderpyl, good afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>(And she goes out, smiling sweetly.)</p>

<p>Two high-school students, at once:
"Can I get 'The Merchant of Venice'
in the Rolfe edition?"</p>

<p>Edgar (to Miss V.): "There's a man
here that wants 'The Only Way.'"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Perhaps he means 'A
Tale of Two Cities,'&mdash;there's a dramatic
version&mdash;"</p>

<p>A thin young man: "Your open-shelf
department is a fine idea, fine! I have been
able to select my own books; I like such
a liberal policy; it shows&mdash;"</p>

<p>A man with a portfolio: "Look here,
miss, here's the best chance you ever see
in your life: the complete Speeches of
William J. Bryan, bound in purple plush,
for six dollars, but we can let you have two
copies for nine seventy five, ev'ry lib'ry in
the country's got it, and Andrew Carnegie
ordered five&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Edgar: "That man says he don't want
the 'Tale of Two Cities,'&mdash;he thinks the
book he's after is 'How To Get In' or
something like that."</p>

<p>Miss V.: "He means 'One Way Out,'&mdash;see
if there is a copy in, will you?"</p>

<p>A woman: "Just let me take that pencil
of yours, a minute?"</p>

<p>A man (mopping his brow): "Say,
what's this 'open-shelf' business,&mdash;d'ye
have to find your own books? Well, that's
the worst thing I ever saw,&mdash;why, at the
Boston Public Library they get 'em for
you!"</p>

<p>A teacher: "Now, I want to return
these three, please, and this is to be transferred
to Miss Jimson's card,&mdash;she'll be
here in a minute, and then I want these two
renewed, and I want to get 'The Century
of the Child,' and if that isn't in I
want&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss V.: "Return the books at the other
desk, please.... Oh, would you mind
returning my pencil?"</p>

<p>The teacher: "Oh, yes, how stupid
of me!"</p>

<p>A woman leading a child: "Haf you de
Deutsches Balladenbuch?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Will you look it up in the
catalogue, please? Over there ... yes,&mdash;look
up the author's name, just like a
dictionary."</p>

<p>A man: "They tell me in the reading-room
that you don't have Victoria Cross's
novels in the library. Now, I would like to
know why that is!"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "You will have to ask the
librarian about it,&mdash;I have nothing to do
with buying the books."</p>

<p>The man: "That's what they told me
in the reading-room, and I tried to see him,
but he isn't in. Everyone trying to dodge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
responsibility, I guess. It makes me sick
the way these libraries are run." (Addressing
the public generally:) "What
right have these library people,&mdash;paid
public servants, public employees, that's all
they are&mdash;what right have they to dictate
what I shall read? Why, her novels are reviewed
in all the best papers on the other
side."</p>

<p>A voice from the rear of the crowd:
"Why don't you do something about it?"</p>

<p>The man: "Well, I'm going to, by
George!"</p>

<p>(He goes away, muttering.)</p>

<p>The woman with the child (returning
triumphant): "Ha! I haf her! Here
she iss!"</p>

<p>(She extends the catalogue card, which
she has ripped forcibly from its drawer.
Miss Wilkins, head cataloguer of the library,
who happens to be passing at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
moment, sees the incident, and sits down
suddenly on a bench, and has recourse to
smelling salts.)</p>

<p>An imposing personage (who has
stalked out from the reference room
bearing a Spanish dictionary, and is followed
excitedly by Miss Barnard, the reference
librarian): "I want to borrow this
dictionary until next Tuesday, and that
woman in there says I can't, just because
it says 'Ref.' on it. <i>I</i> won't hurt it!"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Those books are not allowed
to go out of the library."</p>

<p>The personage: "Why not?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "They are reference books,&mdash;they
are to be used in that room only."</p>

<p>The personage: "Who made that rule?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "The trustees, I suppose,&mdash;it
is one of the rules of the library."</p>

<p>The personage: "Well, I know Colonel
Schwartz!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss V.: "Well, if you will get his
permission, you may take the book,&mdash;I
am not allowed to give it out."</p>

<p>(The personage lays the book on the
desk, from which it is quickly recovered by
Miss Barnard, who hastens back to the
reference room with it.)</p>

<p>The personage: "I've got to get something
like that,&mdash;I had a letter from Havana
this morning, and I want to find out
what it means."</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Oh, we have some books
which will do for that, I think." (To Alfred,
the page.) "Get one of those Spanish
grammars, Alfred,&mdash;be sure and see
that there's a vocabulary in it."</p>

<p>(Alfred returns presently with a
grammar. Miss V. extends her hand
for the personage's library card. The personage
looks at her helplessly, and finally
shakes hands with her, remarking: "Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that's all right, miss,&mdash;don't mention
it!")</p>

<p>Miss V. (becoming rather red): "Your
card?"</p>

<p>The personage (mystified): "Card?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Yes, your library card,&mdash;haven't
you one?"</p>

<p>The personage: "You can search me!"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Why, I can't give you a book
unless you have a card,&mdash;haven't you ever
borrowed books from the library?"</p>

<p>The personage: "Never in my life."
(Suddenly exploding.) "Great Scott! I
never saw so much red tape in my life."</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Well, here&mdash;"</p>

<p>(And she breaks a library rule herself,
by getting the name and address of the personage,
and giving him the book, charged
on her own card. But she gets rid of him
at last.)</p>

<p>A man, with a confidential manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
(leaning over the desk, and whispering):
"Say, lady, I want to get a book."</p>

<p>Miss V.: "What book do you want?"</p>

<p>The confidential man (pursing up his
lips, and nodding his head, as if to tip
her the wink): "Why,&mdash;er, why,&mdash;<i>that
same one</i>, yer know!"</p>

<p>(Miss V. looks at him carefully, but as
she cannot distinguish him amongst the
forty thousand persons who have entered
the library during the past year, she is
forced to make further inquiries.)</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Which same one? I don't
remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>The confidential man: "Why, <i>you</i>
know!" (His manner indicates that it is a
delicate personal secret between Miss V.
and himself.) "That one I had last summer,
yer know."</p>

<p>Miss V.: "What was the title?"</p>

<p>The confidential man: "The title?&mdash;Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the <i>name</i> of it?" (He regards Miss V.
with the tolerant air of one who is humoring
a person whose curiosity verges on the
impertinent.) "Hoh! the <i>name</i> of it! I've
clean forgot <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>(Having thus brushed aside her trivial
question, he regards the ceiling and awaits
the arrival of the book.)</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Who was the author&mdash;who
wrote it?"</p>

<p>(The confidential man is now convinced
that Miss V., for some playful reason of
her own, is merely trying to keep him at
the desk,&mdash;that she has the book within
reach, but chooses to be kittenish about
it. He smiles pleasantly at her.)</p>

<p>The confidential man: "Lord, I dunno!&mdash;Just
let me have it, will yer?" (He
is still quite agreeable&mdash;as if he were
saying: "Come, come, young lady, I
know it's very nice to string out this conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
but, after all, business is business!
Let me have my book, for I must
be going.")</p>

<p>Miss V.: "I'm afraid I can't give it
to you unless you can tell me something
more about it,&mdash;something definite. We
have over four hundred thousand books
in this library, you know, and if you don't
recall the author or the title&mdash;"</p>

<p>(The confidential man receives the
news about the four hundred thousand
books with the air of a person listening to
a fairy tale. The idea that there are as
many books as that in the whole world,
to say nothing of one library, strikes
him as it would if Miss V. should tell
him that she is the rightful Queen of
England.)</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Can't you tell me about the
book,&mdash;what it was about, I mean?"</p>

<p>The confidential man (beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
lose his patience, at last): "<i>About?</i> Why,
it was about a lot of things!"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Was it fiction&mdash;a novel?"</p>

<p>The confidential man: "Huh?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Was it a story? or a book of
travels&mdash;"</p>

<p>(The confidential man gazes at her with
oystery eyes. Suddenly he becomes more
animated.)</p>

<p>The confidential man: "There! It
looked just like that!"</p>

<p>(He points across the desk at a novel
bound in the uniform style of the library
bindery, from which six thousand volumes,
bound precisely alike, come every
year.)</p>

<p>Miss V.: "Is that it?" (She hands
him the book.)</p>

<p>The confidential man: "No, no. Oh,
no. Nothin' like it." (He puts it down,
and wanders away, thinking that he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
come back when there is some intelligent
attendant at the desk.)</p>

<p>An excited person: "Look here, I've
been reading those names on the ceiling,
and Longfellow's isn't there! Now, I'd
like to know why that is!"</p>

<p>Another man: "And they haven't got
'The Appeal to Reason' in the reading
room."</p>

<p>Another man: "That's because it's
Carnegie's library, ain't it, miss?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "No,&mdash;he has nothing to do
with the library at all."</p>

<p>The man: "Why, I thought he run it,
don't he?"</p>

<p>Miss V.: "He gave the money for the
building,&mdash;that is all. He has never
been in it, nor seen it, so far as I know."</p>

<p>The man: "That's all right! I guess
you'll find he runs it, just the same."</p>

<p>The first man: "I guess so, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss V.: "It must keep him rather
busy, don't you think, running all his
libraries?"</p>

<p>The man: "Oh, he can have people in
his pay, all right."</p>

<p>(He and his friend gaze about, to see
if they can detect any of these secret
agents. They both look suspiciously
toward Miss Randlett at the return desk.)</p>

<p>The very large woman (who has returned
to gather up her macaroni, her two
dozen eggs, and her black bag, and to have
her books charged): "Now, here I am at
last! I couldn't get 'Airy, Fairy Lilian,'
but here's 'She Walks in Beauty,' an'
'Miss Petticoats,' an' you can put <i>that</i> on
my card, an' here's Minnie's card for <i>that</i>,
an' if you'll just put the eggs in my bag,
I'll be all right."</p>

<p class="pc2 large">BY-WAYS AND HEDGES</p>

<p class="pn2">Fernald got off the trolley car and
looked about for Graham House. He did
not have to look long, for on the steps of
a brick building there were thirty to fifty
children waiting for the settlement library
to open. That event ought to happen
at seven o'clock, and the illuminated
dial on the fire engine house, across the
street, now indicated five minutes of seven.
Fernald went up the steps, through the
crowd, and turned to the right into the
library room. There was a confusion of
noises&mdash;two or three nervous giggles
and snickers, a loud shuffling of feet, and
a few articulate questions.</p>

<p>"Where's the teacher?"</p>

<p>"Ain't the teacher comin'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mister, you ain't got the lady's job
away from her, have yer?"</p>

<p>And then, apparently in derogation of
the last inquiry: "Shut up, you!"</p>

<p>Fernald took off his coat and left it
on a bench. Then he unlocked the bookcases,
which were instantly surrounded
by a hungry swarm. He took the boxes
of card records from a shelf, and established
himself with rubber stamp, pencil,
and pen at the smaller table. A few children
already sat about the larger table,
looking at the worn copies of "Puck" and
"Collier's." A freckled-faced girl, about
twelve years old, came behind the table
and whispered confidentially into his ear:</p>

<p>"Ain't the real teacher comin', Mister?"</p>

<p>"Yes," explained Fernald, "she is
coming in about half an hour. You
can get your books from me until she
comes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>There was deep, Christian resignation
in the tone, and Fernald felt the rebuke.
At the main library he was superior in
station to the "real teacher," but here his
evident inferiority was painful. But he
had no time to dwell on it, for there were
at least seventeen children, both boys
and girls, from ten to sixteen years old
standing about him on three sides, and
all holding one or two books toward him.
He tried to remember Miss Grant's (the
"real teacher's") final instructions.</p>

<p>"Five cents a week on all books which
have been kept out longer than two weeks.
Don't give back any cards which have
'Fine due' stamped on them. If any of
them ask for new cards, give them a
guarantor's slip, tell them to fill it out,
get it signed by some grown person whose
name is in the directory, and bring it back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
next week. Look out for Minnie Leboskey,
she owes fifteen cents and will try
to get her card back. Don't lose your
temper with them&mdash;they all behave
pretty well, but if any of the boys throw
snowballs in at the top of the window get
Mr. Flaherty, the janitor, to drive them
away."</p>

<p>He looked into the numerous faces,
wondering if the nefarious Minnie Leboskey
were there. In the meanwhile he
was mechanically taking in the books,
stamping the cards, and handing them
back. He noticed that his fingers grew
very sticky in the process. Most of the
children brought another book to the desk
with the one they were returning. This
was one they had already selected from
the shelves, and they now desired to exchange
it for the books they handed in.
Sometimes their preconcerted schemes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
were confusing to the substitute librarian,
as when, for instance:</p>

<p>Theresa Sullivan returned two books,
one of which was to be re-issued immediately
to Margaret Clancy, while the
other was to be charged on the card of
Nora Clancy, who was sick with ammonia
and so couldn't come to the library that
evening. But the book which Margaret
returned must be loaned to Theresa&mdash;that
is, one of them must be, while the
other was to be given into the keeping
of Mary Finnegan, who, in her turn,
brought back three books (two on her
own cards, and one on her mother's), and
her mother wanted the book that Eustacia
O'Brien had returned (there it is,
right on the desk in front of you&mdash;that's
Eustacia over there at the water-cooler),
and please, Mary Finnegan herself wants
this book that Mary Divver has just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
brought in on her white card, and on her
blue card she wants the one she is going
to get (if sundry elbow jabs in the ribs
will have any effect) from Agnes Casey,
and that ain't nothin' on the cover except
a teeny little piece of tolu gum, and Nellie
Sullivan wants to know if "Little
Women" is in, and if it isn't will you
please pick something out for her, Mister,
'cause she has tried four times to get
"Little Women," and please give me this
book that Lizzie Brady has just brought
in on my white card, and this is my blue
card, and my father says that this book on
electric door-knobs ain't no good and he
wants another.</p>

<p>After twenty uninterrupted minutes of
this sort of thing Fernald (who had once
pitched for his class nine and stood calm
while the sophomores exploded bunches
of cannon crackers around him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
sprayed him with a garden hose) felt inclined
to jump up and roar:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, hold your tongues!"</p>

<p>He did nothing of the sort, however,
for at that moment a scuffle broke out at
the bookcase between two boys. He left
his table long enough to separate the
boys and tell them to stop fighting or he
would put them out.</p>

<p>He couldn't help remembering Miss
Grant and her associate, Miss French,
who, after eight hours in the main library
during the day, came over here each
Thursday evening for the mere love
of it.</p>

<p>The chief librarian had visited the place
once&mdash;a year ago, coming at half-past
eight, when all was orderly and quiet. He
looked blandly around for a few moments
and then went away. A few weeks later
he included in his annual report a perfunctory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
sentence about the faithful service
of the two young women.</p>

<p>Miss Grant came at about half-past
seven, and Fernald turned the desk over
to her.</p>

<p>"I wish you would get that red-haired
girl a 'sad book,'" he remarked; "she
has been after me ever since I arrived for
a 'sad book.' Have you anything sufficiently
mournful?"</p>

<p>Miss Grant thought she could supply
the need, but Fernald did not learn what
the book was, for, as she came back from
the shelves, she remarked:</p>

<p>"I am afraid that boy needs watching.
He comes here only for mischief&mdash;never
takes any books."</p>

<p>She indicated a tall, lank youth of unpleasant
countenance, and about fifteen
years old. He was sitting at the center
table, moving the magazines about, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
watching the librarians out of the corners
of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you had trouble with him before?"
asked Fernald.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Miss Grant, "he tripped
me up last Thursday night."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i> Tripped you up?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;stuck out his foot as I went by
the table with an armful of books. I fell
and spilled the books all over the floor."</p>

<p>"Why, the young pup! Shall I put him
out?"</p>

<p>"No; he hasn't done anything to-night."</p>

<p>At this moment the boy seized a magazine
and rapidly slapped three smaller
boys over the head with it. One of the
little boys began to cry, and Mr. Fernald,
remarking, "I guess that will do, won't
it?" conducted the perpetrator of the offence
to the outer door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as he felt the grip on his collar
relax, the boy ran to the middle of the
street, and armed himself, not with the
gentle snowball, but with four or five of
the hard lumps of ice which, mingled with
dirt and gravel, covered the street.</p>

<p>"Come out from in front of that glass
door," the boy shouted, "and let me
have a shot at yer! Aw, yer don't dare
to! Yer're scared to!"</p>

<p>And Mr. Fernald, not being a true
sportsman, had to admit to himself that
he was scared to. He gazed at the boy
a moment or two, and then went slowly
inside. The boy set up a derisive yell,
showing that the victory remained with
the Child of Darkness, as it frequently
does.</p>

<p class="p2">His experience of one evening in the
settlement library made Fernald anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to see more of the work. He returned on
the following Thursday, but a little later
than the time of his first visit. It was
half-past seven, and the settlement was in
full swing. Loud whoops and yells, combined
with noise as of a herd of buffaloes,
indicated that a basketball game was in
progress in the basement gymnasium.
The rumble and crash of a bowling alley
were partly drowned by the cries from a
back room, where various minor games
were being enjoyed. The two library assistants,
Miss Grant and Miss French,
were dispensing books in the room near
the entrance.</p>

<p>Fernald had just taken his coat off
when Mr. Flaherty, the janitor, beckoned
him to the door of the library by the nonchalant
method of standing in the door
and throwing his chin in the air with a
series of short jerks. When Fernald went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
across the room to find what was wanted,
Mr. Flaherty drew him mysteriously into
the passage.</p>

<p>"Say, I guess yer got into some trouble
here last week, didn't yer?"</p>

<p>"Trouble? No; I don't remember any
trouble."</p>

<p>"Didn't yer put a feller out, or somethin'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I forgot. I did put a boy
out. What's the matter&mdash;is he back
again?"</p>

<p>"Him? No. The old man's here,
though. Been waitin' for an hour. Says
he's going to have the law on yer."</p>

<p>Fernald became interested.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"He's in here. Been settin' by the
stove, and now he's gone to sleep. I'll
send him out to yer. But don't yer worry
about no law. Godfrey! I've had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
more'n forty of 'em goin' to have the
law on me."</p>

<p>"I'm not worried," Fernald assured
him, and the other departed in search of
the wrathful parent.</p>

<p>This person soon appeared in the form
of a short, stout man with a straggly
yellow moustache and a very red face.
He had enormously long arms, so that his
hat, which he carried in one hand, hung
nearly on a level with his ankles. He was
blinking at the lights, and was plainly
more than half asleep. Also it was evident
that the wrath had gone out of him.
He looked inquiringly at Fernald, as
though the librarian, not he, were seeking
the interview. He continued to blink,
until at last Fernald had to begin the
conversation.</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me? Something
about your son?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Say, he come home, an' he
says you put him outer here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," replied Fernald; "that
was a week ago to-night. And if I had
been here two weeks ago, and had had
a cow-hide, I would have given him a
good licking. He needs one."</p>

<p>The man looked greatly astonished, but
said nothing, so the librarian continued:</p>

<p>"I put him out last week for banging
three little boys over the heads with a
magazine. I had been watching him for
ten minutes. He doesn't come in here to
play in the gymnasium&mdash;which is what
he needs&mdash;nor to read. He comes into the
library every week just to raise the devil.
This was the first time he had ever
touched a book&mdash;when he picked up one
to lambaste these boys with it. And two
weeks ago he stuck his foot out when
one of the women who had charge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
library was passing the table, and she
tripped and fell flat, with an armful of
books. If he wants to come back and
behave, he may, but he can't come
otherwise."</p>

<p>"He says you choked him," remarked
the man.</p>

<p>"He lies," said Fernald. "I took him
by the collar and put him out&mdash;that's
all. He was quite able, as soon as I let
him go, to run into the street and pick
up half a dozen lumps of ice, and swear
at me, and dare me to come out from in
front of the glass door, so he could have
the pleasure of breaking my face without
any risk of breaking the glass."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," the man returned, "it's
all right then. As soon as I see you, I
knew it was all right."</p>

<p>Fernald was somewhat mystified at the
impression he had made. He was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
especially tremendous physically, and although
he came clad in the armor of
righteousness on this particular occasion,
he had no delusions about the effect that
kind of armor is likely to have on a man
of this sort. But the father of the boy
went on to explain:</p>

<p>"Say, yer know, I didn't know but it
was some of these here kids that had been
pickin' on him. I wouldn't stand for that,
yer know. But soon's I see you I knew
it was all right. Say, he ain't got no business
here, anyhow. I told him so. I don't
want him to come. It ain't a fit place."</p>

<p>And the man departed, wishing the librarian
good-night. Fernald was thoroughly
resigned to the idea of the boy
not coming any more, but he could not
help smiling at the idea that it wasn't a
fit place. Graham House, the pet charity
of a large and prosperous church, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
been described in the words that its officers
might have used of some particularly obnoxious
saloon or gambling joint. He
imagined how the Rev. Alexander Lambeth,
who came over once or twice a week
to smile around the place, clerically&mdash;how
he would look at hearing one of the
residents of the neighborhood describe it
as not "a fit place" for his son to visit
in the evening.</p>

<p>Fernald went back into the library
room. It was crowded with children, and
the two librarians had their hands full.
One of them was charging books at the
desk; the other was making desperate endeavors
to get the books in the cases in
some sort of order, to find certain volumes
which some of the children wished,
to keep the children fairly quiet, and, in
general, to regulate the discipline of the
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no particularly ill-behaved
youngsters&mdash;one or two who were pretending
to look at the "picture papers" at
the table, in reality were merely waiting
for a chance to get into a scuffle, or in some
other way to "put the liberry on the bum."</p>

<p>The children's room at the central library
was a quieter place. It was in a
much quieter part of the town; the impressive
architecture (impressive to children,
at least), spacious rooms, and other
accessories produced a more typical "library
atmosphere."</p>

<p>Here, the fact that their feet were on
their native heath, the familiar noises of
wagons and clanging trolley cars outside,
and the hubbub of the gymnasium below,
all conspired to make the children a little
more restless.</p>

<p>Fernald listened to Miss Grant, who sat
at the desk with fifteen girls and boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and one or two older persons around her.
The older ones were parents or friends
who lived in the neighborhood and frequented
the library. Miss Grant was discharging
the books as they were returned,
charging new ones, and incidentally acting
as literary adviser and bureau of
information.</p>

<p>"Is this the one you want&mdash;'The Halfback'?
It hasn't been discharged&mdash;who
brought this in? Oh, you did&mdash;you're
returning it? You mustn't take the card
out till I have stamped it. And this is
the book you want to take?"</p>

<p>A voice from the rear of the crowd:
"No, 'm, that's mine."</p>

<p>Another voice: "'Tain't neither,
teacher, it's mine; she promised it to me
last Choosday."</p>

<p>The first voice: "Oh, you big&mdash;I
didn't do nothin' of the sort, teacher!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>A man, elbowing his way to the front,
and relying on the fascinations of his
dyed moustache and hat tilted to one
side: "Say, jus' gimme this, will yer?"</p>

<p>While Miss Grant is charging the book,
he leans over her confidentially:</p>

<p>"Say, don't you or that other young
lady belong to the Order of the Golden
Bazoo? Don't yer? Say, that's too bad&mdash;we're
goin' to have a little dance to-morrer
night at the Red Men's hall.
We'd be glad to have yer come. Say,
you can come anyway&mdash;I can get yer
in all right Yer can meet me at the
drugstore on the corner, here, and
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>A small girl with a red tam-o'shanter,
interrupting: "Teacher, me an' Minnie
Leboskey just took out these books&mdash;this
is mine&mdash;'The Birds' Chris'mas Carol'
and this is Minnie's&mdash;'Sarter Resortus'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
an' Minnie has read it hundreds of times,
an' she says she don't want it again, an'
please, teacher, this here is a kid's book,
an' I don't want it, an' will yer give me
somethin' for my mother, she says she's
read the one you sent her last week, an'
can she take the White House Cook Book,
too, on the same card?"</p>

<p>A tall and very resolute-looking woman,
with three books under her arm: "Have
you got 'The Leopard's Spots' in this
library? I want my son to read it. He
has just finished 'The Clansman,' but he
has never read 'The Leopard's Spots.'"</p>

<p>Miss Grant: "Why, how old is he?"</p>

<p>The resolute-looking woman, presenting
cherubic-faced urchin: "This is him&mdash;he'll
be twelve next April."</p>

<p>Miss Grant: "I'm sure we have some
other books that he'll like better than
'The Leopard's Spots.' That is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
child's book&mdash;there is a copy at the
central library, but it is not kept in the
children's room. Wouldn't you like&mdash;"</p>

<p>The resolute-looking woman: "No, I
wouldn't. I know what I want. I'm his
mother, and I guess I know what's what.
You needn't try to dictate to me. Have
you got it here or haven't you? That's
all I want to know. I can't find it over
there on those shelves."</p>

<p>Miss Grant: "No; we have not."</p>

<p>The woman: "All right, then, I'll go
somewhere else&mdash;for he's goin' to read
that book, whether or no."</p>

<p>A young lady, an acquaintance of Miss
Grant, who thinks she is doing a little
slumming: "Oh, Miss Grant, how do you
do? I promised that I'd come and help
you, you know. How perfectly delightful
this is&mdash;only some boys on the corner
threw snowballs at Jean and he wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
bring the automobile nearer than the next
block&mdash;he's waiting there now, and he's
terribly peeved. Now, what shall I do&mdash;shall
I sit down here and help you?"</p>

<p>A small boy: "Say, teacher, come over
here an' make this feller give me my
book."</p>

<p>Another small boy: "Aw, I ain't got
his book."</p>

<p>First small boy: "Yes, yer have, too!"</p>

<p>The other small boy: "No, I ain't&mdash;"</p>

<p>His remarks end in a yelp as the elbow
of the first boy goes home in his ribs.
The two clinch, and fall over a settee,
from which they are pulled up and separated
by Mr. Fernald. The young lady
in search of slumming experiences observes
that another small boy is experimenting
with a penful of red ink, while
Miss Grant's back is turned, to see how
far he can flip the ink. The young lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
decides she will go and see if her chauffeur
is in any further trouble, and she departs
hastily, assuring the librarian that she
will return soon. She does not reappear,
however.</p>

<p>A youth, apparently a butcher's assistant,
wearing a blue frock, and carrying
a slice of meat (for which some family
is indignantly waiting): "Say, miss, my
grandmother wanted me to get her a book
called&mdash;say, it had a funny name, it was
'It Didn't Use to Be,' or something like
that. Have you got it?"</p>

<p>Miss Grant: "Yes, I think so. You
go over to Miss French&mdash;the lady across
the room there, and ask her to see if
'It Never Can Happen Again' is on the
shelves."</p>

<p>The youth: "That was it, I knew it was
something like that."</p>

<p>A severe-looking woman, about thirty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
years old: "Good evening. Have
you ever read this book?"</p>

<p>She exhibits a copy of "Barrack Room
Ballads," and does not wait for Miss
Grant to reply. "I have not read the
whole of it&mdash;I only looked into it here
and there. It ought not be in any library&mdash;it
is full of the most disgusting profanity.
You ought to know about it, and
you ought to withdraw it from the shelves
immediately."</p>

<p>Katie Finnegan, aged fifteen, leaning
heavily on Miss Grant's left shoulder,
and whispering into Miss Grant's left ear:
"Teacher, are you goin' to let me walk
home with you to-night?"</p>

<p>Maggie Burke, aged thirteen, leaning
on Miss Grant's right shoulder, and
whispering into Miss Grant's right ear:
"Say, Miss Grant, I think your hat is just
lovely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>A serious-faced man, evidently a workingman
in his best clothes: "Haven't
you got the Encyclopædia Britannica
here? I can't find it on those tables."</p>

<p>A girl of twelve: "Teacher, I want Tolstoi's
'Little Women.'"</p>

<p>A deeply irritated man: "Look here,
I'd like to know what this means! D'ye
see this postal? Well, look there: 'Please
return Evans's 'A Sailor's Log' which is
charged on your card. The fine amounts
to twenty cents.' I ain't never had no
book outer this place!"</p>

<p>Miss Grant: "Perhaps you took it from
the central library, or one of the other
branches?"</p>

<p>The irritated one: "No, I didn't neither.
I ain't never had no books outer no
library!"</p>

<p>His companion, another man, with
views on capital and labor: "Aw, it's just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
one of Carnegie's games to get money out
of yer."</p>

<p>The irritated man: "Well, he won't get
no money outer me."</p>

<p>Miss Grant, who has read the name
"John Smith" on the other side of the
post-card: "Perhaps this came to you by
mistake&mdash;it was meant for someone else
of the same name, maybe."</p>

<p>The irritated man: "Well, you can keep
it&mdash;I don't want it, anyhow."</p>

<p>He and his friend depart, much pleased
at having baffled Carnegie this time.</p>

<p>Miss French, the other librarian, laying
a very dirty slip of paper on Miss Grant's
desk: "What do you suppose this means?
There is a boy waiting for the book, but
we haven't anything about shingling&mdash;I've
looked in the catalogue twice."</p>

<p>Miss Grant read the note, which ran:
"plees give barer why not shingel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
house and oblige Mrs. coffey 2795 forth
street."</p>

<p>Miss Grant: "Oh, yes&mdash;just write her
a note, will you, Miss French? Tell her
we haven't any of Frank Danby's books.
She wants 'Let the Roof Fall In,' you
know."</p>

<p>A small boy: "Have you any books
about explosions? Mother says she wants
one about the Pan-American explosion."</p>

<p>Another small boy: "Haven't you got
the Mutt and Jeff book yet? When are
you goin' to get it?"</p>

<p>A small girl: "Please, can I keep this
book on how to bring up parrots till next
week?"</p>

<p>The janitor of the building: "Closin'
time in five minutes, Miss."</p>

<p>Two women: "Oh, what's he putting
out the lights for? I haven't found a
book yet!"</p>

<p class="pc large">MULCH</p>

<p class="pn2">Toward spring the books on gardening
begin to come into the library, and I
look them over with fresh enthusiasm.
Mrs. Bunkum is no longer my favorite
author in this field, but her sister writers
are very dear to my heart.</p>

<p>There is Mrs. Reginald Creasus. I
seize her latest volume with the eagerness
of a child. I like to see the pictures of the
new marble bench which she has imported
from Pompeii and set up at the end of the
Rose Walk. Then she usually has a new
sculptured group&mdash;a fountain, or some
other little trifle by Rodin or St. Gaudens,
which looks so well amidst the Japanese
iris.</p>

<p>After gazing at these illustrations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
a while, I go home and observe the red
woodshed, and I declare it looks altogether
different. It is wonderful how discontented
with your lot you can get by reading
Mrs. Creasus's books on gardening.
Sometimes I think that I am making a
mistake in voting the Republican ticket,
year after year. Mr. Debs may be right,
after all.</p>

<p>This year Mrs. Creasus calls her volume
"The Simple Garden." From it I
gathered that anyone who knows anything
at all will not pass the summer without
an Abyssinian hibiscus unfolding its lovely
blooms somewhere on the place. They are
absolutely necessary, in fact. You have
to be careful with them&mdash;when you plant
them, that is. The fertilizer which they
require has to be fetched from the island
of Ascension. I calculated that by going
without food or clothes for two years I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
could just about buy and support one of
them.</p>

<p>I wish Mrs. Creasus would write a book
about the complicated garden. I should
like to see it.</p>

<p>Just as I had bought a garden hose,
along came Mrs. Creasus's book, remarking
casually that it is well to have the
whole garden laid out with underground
water-pipes, placed at least six feet below
the surface, to avoid frost. Two or three
private reservoirs are, of course, an essential.
I wonder what Mrs. Creasus
keeps in these reservoirs. I suppose it
is champagne, but I wouldn't like to
ask.</p>

<p>Scotch gardeners are going out, she says.
The Chinese are the only kind, although
they demand&mdash;and get&mdash;forty to fifty
dollars more per month than the others.
I made a note to employ no more Scotchmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and then I looked to see what she
had to say about sweet-peas.</p>

<p>She was ever so enthusiastic about them.
No family should be without sweet-peas,
she said. You dig a trench, and you put in
four or five different kinds of dressing,
separated by layers of earth, and then you
plant the peas, and as fast as they come
up you keep discouraging them by putting
more earth and things on top, and then
you build a trellis for them to run on,
sinking the posts not less than four feet,
and there you are.</p>

<p>Only&mdash;you must mulch them.</p>

<p>Mulch! That struck me as a pleasant
word. It had a nice squshy sound about
it. I thought it would be so nice, on hot
evenings, to go around mulching and
mulching.</p>

<p>I went to the dictionary to look it up
and find out what it meant, but just at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that minute General Bumpus came into
my office. He was interested to see Mrs.
Creasus's book lying open on my desk&mdash;he
is president of the library board, and
he is another gardening enthusiast.</p>

<p>"Going to have some sweet-peas?" he
asked, observing the picture.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I thought I would."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "that's all right.
Only you must mulch them good and
plenty."</p>

<p>"Is that necessary?" I inquired, looking
him straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;absolutely."</p>

<p>Before we could say anything more
about it, someone came in to tell the general
that Mrs. Bumpus said the horses
were uneasy, and that she wished he
would come out. He went away, and then
Miss Davis came to get me&mdash;there was
a man in the reading-room, who wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
me to give him permission to break some
rule or other. So I forgot all about the
sweet-peas until I was on my way home.
Then I stepped in at the seed shop to get
the peas.</p>

<p>Philip Morris was there, buying a
lawn-mower. He had paid for it, and
was starting toward the door, when he
saw me.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Buying sweet-peas?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Have you ever raised any?"</p>

<p>"Tried to. One year they didn't come
up at all, and another year the cut-worms
got 'em, and another they just sort of
sickened and died. But I didn't mulch
'em&mdash;that was the trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, why <i>didn't</i> you mulch 'em?"</p>

<p>"Why, I would have, but&mdash;George!
that's my car! Good-night!"</p>

<p>And he rushed out.</p>

<p>I did not like to display my ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
before the dealer, so I merely took the
peas and started up the street with them.
Inside of two minutes I met Miss Abernathy.
She has a marvelous flower-garden.
I stopped her and told her of my
purchase.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to have sweet-peas!
I envy you. I've never been very successful
with them."</p>

<p>"What happened to them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. They seemed to get
disappointed&mdash;they need very rich soil."</p>

<p>"Maybe," I suggested tentatively, "you
didn't mulch 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't make any difference."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>And she bade me good evening, and
passed on.</p>

<p>When I reached home and had eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
dinner, I told Jane that I was going to
plant some sweet-peas. I described the
process to her. She was very much interested,
and offered to help. I dug the
trench and put in the peas. I thought
some bushes might do instead of Mrs.
Creasus's trellis.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "all they need is to be
mulched."</p>

<p>"To be what?" asked Jane.</p>

<p>"Mulched. You always have to mulch
sweet-peas; that is, Mrs. Creasus and
General Bumpus, and Philip Morris say
so, but Miss Abernathy thinks not."</p>

<p>"How do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Jane, do you mean to say that you do
not know how to mulch?"</p>

<p>"Of course I don't. How do you do
it?"</p>

<p>I felt in my pocket.</p>

<p>"Can't you roll me a cigarette? There's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
some paper and tobacco in the house&mdash;on
my desk."</p>

<p>Jane went dutifully away, and when she
returned, I lighted the cigarette.</p>

<p>"There," I said, "they're all mulched&mdash;I
did it with this hoe."</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> what it means?"</p>

<p class="pn2">All this happened in April, and now it
is August, and the sweet-peas still maintain
a somewhat sullen appearance. I
wonder if Miss Abernathy was right, after
all. Perhaps I did wrong to mulch them,&mdash;at
least, so savagely.</p>

<p class="pn2">Mr. Anthony Gooch, brother of
the well-known librarian of East Caraway,
owns one of the choicest private libraries
it has ever been my good luck to
see. I spent an evening with him recently
and inspected his books. Mr. Anthony
Gooch was highly amused at the account
of his brother's literary zoölogical
annex, which I wrote for the "Boston
Transcript."</p>

<p>"Percival has tacked that barn on his
library," he said, "and filled it with all
those absurd animals&mdash;not one-half of
which are genuine. Poor Percy! The
dealers have pulled his leg unmercifully.
And he spends all his evenings and holidays
shoveling hay to those preposterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
elephants, and wandering around in that
menagerie&mdash;I'm afraid the old fellow is
getting dotty. Why, what do you think
he told me last week?"</p>

<p>I had not the least idea, and I said so.</p>

<p>"Why, he is negotiating with a London
dealer for the oysters mentioned in
'The Walrus and the Carpenter'! You
remember them, of course?"</p>

<p>And Mr. Gooch, leaning back in his
chair and waving the stem of his long
pipe in time with the beat of Lewis Carroll's
exquisite verses, repeated:</p>

<p class="ppqi4 p1">"'But four young Oysters hurried up,<br />
All eager for the treat:</p>
<p class="ppqn4">Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br />
Their shoes were clean and neat&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppqn4">And this was odd, because, you know,<br />
They hadn't any feet.</p>

<p class="p1">"I told him that he was being cheated,
for the poem distinctly states (see stanza
18, lines 5 and 6) that the Walrus and
the Carpenter ate all the oysters. But
he replied that perhaps these were some
of the Elder Oysters, for in the poem it
says:</p>

<p class="ppqi4 p1">"'The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br />
But never a word he said:</p>
<p class="ppqn4">The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br />
And shook his heavy head&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppqn4">Meaning to say he did not choose<br />
To leave the oyster-bed.'"</p>

<p class="p1">"It is useless to argue with him," continued
Mr. Anthony Gooch, "and if his
trustees will let him spend the money, I
suppose I ought not mind. Still I do
hate to think of the name of Gooch being
connected with a fraudulent collection."</p>

<p>I agreed that it was distressing, and
remarked that I thought it curious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
one brother should be a collector and
the other have no interest in that kind of
hobby. For Anthony Gooch's library is
remarkably free from all items that appeal
merely to the bibliomaniac. His
books are beautiful, but they are to be
read, and Mr. Gooch has read them. He
owns no unopened copies, nor any such
nonsense. My host smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, of course I do not go in for
fakes, and I certainly do not care to act
as keeper to a lot of crocodiles, and
flounders, and jackdaws, and other livestock,
as Percival does. Still, my little
museum&mdash;you have never seen it? Come
this way."</p>

<p>Mr. Gooch led me to a door at the right
of the fireplace, between two bookcases.
He opened the door, turned on the
lights, and we entered a small room. I
exclaimed with astonishment, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
stood in an arsenal&mdash;or, rather, an
armory.</p>

<p>The walls were lined with weapons.
Stands of arms were in the corners, and
a number of flags and banners hung from
the ceiling. The weapons were of every
variety and period. Old spears and battleaxes,
stone hatchets, bows and sheaves of
arrows&mdash;these were mingled with modern
rifles, automatic pistols, and bowie knives.
Daggers of a dozen patterns hung on the
walls or lay on the tables. One or two
ancient pieces of artillery&mdash;culverins and
drakes, I fancy&mdash;were in a corner, together
with a quick-firing gun from some
modern man-of-war.</p>

<p>"These," said Mr. Gooch, looking me
in the eye, very seriously, "are absolutely
genuine&mdash;every one of them. And not
one but has figured in some scene in literature.
I have spent fifteen years in assembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
this collection, and&mdash;well, I
prize it highly. That is one of the reasons
why it disgusts me to have my brother
Percival waste his time over that ridiculous
aggregation of animals, so many of
which are sheer frauds. It tends to bring
my collection of weapons under suspicion,
and I do not need to say that I cannot
bear to have anyone doubt the absolute
authenticity of my treasures. If you feel
any doubt about them I wish you would say
so now, and we will go back to the library."</p>

<p>But I told Mr. Gooch that suspicion was
a trait foreign to my nature.</p>

<p>"Long ago," I said, "I took the advice
of the White Queen in 'Through the
Looking-Glass,' and practised believing
impossible things for half an hour every
day. Like her, sometimes I've believed
as many as six impossible things before
breakfast."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I have no hesitation in showing
you my collection," remarked Mr. Gooch.
"Look at this sword&mdash;it is the envenomed
rapier of Laertes, dipped in an
unction which he bought of a mountebank.
Be careful not to touch the point&mdash;I
think some of the poison lingers on it now,
and it has already been responsible for
two&mdash;no, three deaths. You remember
that Hamlet used it to kill the king, after
it had wounded both him and Laertes in
the fencing bout."</p>

<p>I put down the rapier gingerly, and inquired
about a flint-lock pistol which lay
on the table near at hand. Mr. Gooch
told me that it was the weapon owned
by Madame Defarge, through which she
came to her death.</p>

<p>"And what was probably worse, from
her point of view," added the collector,
"she was thus unavoidably detained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
her front seat at the guillotine, on that
day of days, when she hoped to see the
Marquis of Evremond lose his life. Someone
has said that the whole French Revolution
seemed to have been brought about
so Madame Defarge might have her revenge&mdash;so,
of course, the blow was a
severe one to her. This pistol exploded
while she was struggling with Miss Pross
in the empty house, and the explosion killed
her and deafened Miss Pross. Even then
the tumbril was carrying Sydney Carton to
the guillotine."</p>

<p>"Your relics are rather gruesome," I
observed.</p>

<p>"I pride myself that there are more
horrors comprised in this small room than
in most of its size," said Mr. Gooch. "But
they are not all connected with tragedies.
Here, for instance, is the mace which the
White Knight used in his battle with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Red Knight, and I have also&mdash;up there
on the wall&mdash;his sword&mdash;made of a lath,
you see. Still, weapons are naturally instruments
of crime, or, at any rate, of violence,
and some very notorious murders
are commemorated here."</p>

<p>He picked up a long, blood-stained
knife.</p>

<p>"With this," he said, "Markheim
killed the shopkeeper. One of the very
finest murders in literature, in my opinion.
You recall the circumstances: Christmas
Day, the two men alone in the shop&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," I replied, willing to show
my familiarity with Stevenson's wonderful
tale, "and I remember the terrible
moments that followed&mdash;the murderer
alone with the dead man, the silence, the
ticking of the clocks, the man who knocked
on the outside door, and all the rest of it."</p>

<p>Mr. Gooch replaced the knife and drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
my attention to a shield and a long spear
which hung on the wall. These, he said,
belonged to a "Fuzzy-Wuzzy"&mdash;they
were a "coffin-'eaded shield an' shovel-spear,"
the implements for a 'appy day
with Fuzzy on the rush. Near them hung
an old flint-lock musket. It was a perfect
wreck&mdash;the stock worm-eaten, and the
lock and barrel covered with rust.</p>

<p>"It was never used to kill anything
more dangerous than a squirrel or a wild
goose," said my host; "yet its original
owner was nearly arrested for carrying
it on one occasion. Surely you can guess
who that owner was."</p>

<p>I guessed Rip Van Winkle, and Mr.
Gooch said that was correct.</p>

<p>"It doesn't improve a musket or a man
to lie out on the mountains day and night
for twenty years," he added.</p>

<p>Then he showed me Othello's sword of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Spain, "of the ice-brook's temper," with
which the Moor smote himself, as once
in Aleppo he smote a malignant and a
turban'd Turk.</p>

<p>"This box," said Mr. Gooch, "contains
one of my greatest prizes&mdash;nothing less
than the dagger which led Macbeth to
Duncan's sleeping chamber&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it was an 'air-drawn dagger'&mdash;it
was imaginary," I began.</p>

<p>And then the old story about the man
and his mongoose recurred to me, and I
stopped. I looked in the box, and, of
course, found it empty. The collector of
weapons laughed and seemed greatly delighted
with his little joke. I judged that
he was accustomed to play it on every
visitor.</p>

<p>"What is this bottle? It seems out of
place here."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Mr. Gooch; "it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Falstaff's pocket pistol. This cane once
belonged to Mr. Wackford Squeers, but
it was used on only one occasion, and then
against the owner himself, by Nicholas
Nickleby."</p>

<p>He then showed me a sword broken
near the hilt.</p>

<p>"It was Henry Esmond's. He broke it
when he denied the Prince, and heaped
reproaches upon him for going dangling
after Beatrix, when the opportunity of
his life was at hand. Little the Prince
cared! He deigned, a few moments later,
to cross swords with Esmond, and Frank
used this broken blade to strike up their
weapons. It was such a condescension!
Esmond knew the Prince to be worthless,
and he had just been insulting him in every
way he could think. But he was of the
sacred blood of the Stuarts&mdash;enough for
any Jacobite. You will find a full account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of it in the novel, if you care to refresh
your memory. This is a cigar-cutter's
knife&mdash;a curious weapon, isn't it? Carmen
used it to slash the face of the woman
she quarreled with&mdash;she cut a neat St.
Andrew's cross on her enemy's cheek.
That led to her subsequent arrest by Don
José, the escape at which he connived,
and all the train of events which followed.
This is the knife that Don José killed
Carmen with."</p>

<p>"How did you get all these weapons?"
I asked him.</p>

<p>"Oh, in various ways. It requires a
great deal of patience, some money, and
some imagination. I traveled for three
or four years, but since then I have had
to employ agents. Some authors would
almost fill this room by themselves, if I
cared to collect all the weapons for which
they are responsible. See all those spears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and broadswords&mdash;that is my Sir Thomas
Malory corner. Walter Scott covered almost
that entire wall&mdash;spears, claymores,
daggers, battleaxes and pistols. I could
not get the sword of Saladin&mdash;that, like
some other valuable pieces, is owned by
a Virtuoso, of whom you may have heard.
This sword was used by Rudolf Rassendyll&mdash;he
employed it in freeing the
prisoner of Zenda. A revolver would have
been quicker, probably, but not half so
picturesque. I was glad to get that sword,
but I soon had to stop buying the mass of
cutlery that came into the market shortly
after it was forged. I could have filled
my house with it. Poor weapons they
were, mostly. See those rapiers over the
fireplace&mdash;they are of the finest temper,
and came from Alexandre Dumas. The
one on the left, of somewhat the same
shape, was used by A Gentleman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
France. That spear was carried by the
squire of Sir Nigel Loring when he rode
into Spain at the head of the White Company.
There is the good broadsword of
young Lochinvar, and this is the sword
with which Horatius held the bridge in
the brave days of old."</p>

<p>"The one with which he killed the
Lord of Luna?'</p>

<p>"Precisely. How does it go?"</p>

<p class="ppqi4 p1">"'Through teeth, and skull, and helmet,<br />
So fierce a thrust he sped</p>
<p class="ppqn4">The good sword stood a handbreadth out<br />
Behind the Tuscan's head.'</p>

<p class="p1">"No one does anything like that now.
Those were the days!"</p>

<p>"They were, certainly. The two swords
next to Horatius's&mdash;who owned them?"</p>

<p>"Lord Barnard and Little Musgrave.
You know the old ballad?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>And Mr. Gooch quoted again:</p>

<p class="ppqi4 p1">"'The first stroke little Musgrave struck,<br />
He hurt Lord Barnard sore;</p>
<p class="ppqn4">The next stroke that Lord Barnard struck,<br />
Little Musgrave never struck more.'"</p>

<p class="p1">Then the collector showed me a rifle of
modern pattern.</p>

<p>"The regular rifle of the British army
twenty years ago. This belonged to Private
Stanley Ortheris. He took it with
him that day he went out to look for a
native deserter who was making things
unpleasant by night for the old regiment.
Ortheris had his two companions with
him, and while they waited Learoyd told
the story 'On Greenhow Hill.' At its end,
the deserter appeared and Ortheris ended
his career at long range. 'Mayhap there
was a lass tewed up wi' him, too,' opined
Learoyd."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>I nodded, for I liked the story well.</p>

<p>"Here is the pistol," said Mr. Gooch,
"that was found by the side of Mr. John
Oakhurst, gambler, who struck a streak
of bad luck on the 23d of November, 1850,
and handed in his checks on the 7th of
December, 1850."</p>

<p>Then I asked about a hammer that lay
among other objects on the table.</p>

<p>"It is not a weapon, exactly," admitted
Mr. Gooch, "but it belonged to Adam
Bede. He used it in making a coffin, the
night his father was drowned. The musket
is the one with which Carver Doone
shot Lorna in the church. That peculiar
machine in the corner? It doesn't look
earthly, does it? As a matter of fact, it
is a heat ray apparatus which was employed
by the Martians in the War of the
Worlds."</p>

<p>We moved around the room slowly, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Gooch sometimes pointing to weapons
which hung high above our heads, and
sometimes taking them down so I could
examine them closely. In this more satisfactory
fashion he now showed me a remarkable
axe. The haft was of rhinoceros
horn, wound with copper wire.
This handle was over a yard long. The
head was of steel. As I had suspected,
the axe had belonged to Umslopogaas, the
Zulu warrior. With this axe he had
terrorized the French cook Alphonse, and
with it he fought his great fight at the
head of the stairway. It had numerous
nicks in the horn handle&mdash;each nick representing
a man killed with it in battle.</p>

<p>"Here is another knife which figured
in a murder," said Mr. Gooch. "Tess
killed Alec D'Urberville with it. And
this is the unsheathed sword that lay between
Tristram and Iseult."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>On a shelf in a corner was a piece of
some red stone. I inquired about it, remarking
that it did not seem to belong
to the collection,</p>

<p>"No, it does not," Mr. Gooch agreed,
"but it served very effectively on a certain
occasion. That was the meeting of
the scientific society on the Stanislow. If
I can quote correctly, the incident is described
as follows:</p>

<p class="ppqi6 p1">"'Then Peleg Jones of Angels raised a point of order, when</p>
<p class="ppi">A chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppi">And he smiled a kind of sickly smile, and curled up on the floor,</p>
<p class="ppi">And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.'</p>

<p class="p1">"I remember now," said I, "it was the
beginning of a serious battle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; events followed fast and furious&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppqi6 p1">"'In less time than it takes to tell it, every member did engage</p>
<p class="ppi">In a battle with those remnants of a paleozoic age,</p>
<p class="ppi">And the way they hurled those fossils in their anger was a sin&mdash;</p>
<p class="ppi">Till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of Thompson in.'"</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Gooch then showed me Bob Acres'
dueling pistols. They gave no signs of
having been used, and it is doubtful if
they would have been very deadly at forty
paces&mdash;Bob's favorite fighting distance.
Here was also the cross-bow, with which
the Ancient Mariner killed the albatross.
I found, hanging from a hook, two curious
weapons which resembled light darts,
or spears. My host reached them down
for me, and I looked them over closely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Their composition was apparent&mdash;the
halves of a pair of scissors had been tied
to two wands.</p>

<p>"They look much more harmless than
Bob Acres' pistols, do they not? As a
matter of fact, they were used in a duel,
and one of them killed its man. The duel
was fought in Edinburgh Castle between
two French prisoners,&mdash;one of whom was
St. Ives."</p>

<p>"And the lasso that hangs above
them?"</p>

<p>"Employed in a tournament by a Connecticut
Yankee at King Arthur's Court,&mdash;until
Merlin stole it. This is the sword
with which Sergeant Troy displayed his
dexterity before Bathsheba Everdene.
And this blade you have heard celebrated
in song a good many times&mdash;it is the
Sword of Bunker Hill. And with this
Miles Standish stirred the posset. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
is the revolver with which Sherlock
Holmes used to amuse himself in his room
on Baker street&mdash;sitting in his chair, and
making a patriotic 'V. R.' in bullet pocks
on the wall, much to the annoyance of the
good Dr. Watson. These daggers are
rather odd&mdash;four of them, and two
swords, you see. They came from 'The
Critic' where the two Nieces draw their
two daggers to strike Whiskerandos, the
two Uncles point their swords at Whiskerandos,
and he draws two daggers and
holds them to the two Nieces' bosoms. So
they would have stood forever, if the Beefeater
hadn't come in and commanded
them, in the queen's name, to drop their
weapons. There's the Beefeater's halberd,
too. Doubtless you've wondered at
this naval gun. It fired the shot that did
the business for the 'Haliotis,' and gave
Kipling a chance to air his knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
engines and machinery in general. You
can read about it in 'The Devil and the
Deep Sea' This sword is in its sheath,
you see,</p>

<p class="ppqs4 p1">'His sword was in its sheath,<br />
His fingers held the pen,</p>
<p class="ppqn4">When Kempenfelt went down<br />
With twice four hundred men.'</p>

<p class="p1">"I've plenty of swords&mdash;here's the
one that pierced the Master of Ballantrae,
when he and his brother fought together
by candle-light. This pretty little pair of
scissors? They helped in the Rape of the
Lock. This stone-headed club is my oldest
specimen&mdash;it belonged to Ab&mdash;you know
his story, no doubt? And the big axe
was carried by the Executioner when the
Queen of Hearts went about shouting,
'Off with their heads!'"</p>

<p>"That is a beautiful dagger," I remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it? It was brought by some
Italian twins to a village in Missouri,
where it had an exciting history. Look at
the finger prints in blood on the handle.
They betrayed a murderer, and he was
denounced in court by Pudd'nhead
Wilson."</p>

<p>We had finished our circuit of the room,
and it was time for me to bid Mr. Gooch
good-night. I started to thank him
for showing me his collection, but he
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right; but," he added,
laying his hand on my shoulder in a paternal
fashion, "one last request: if you
write it up for the 'Transcript,' don't try
to be funny! I do hate to have books, and
libraries, and literature treated flippantly.
Now, I read your column&mdash;oh! very
often&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he persisted, "I <i>really</i> do!
After I have finished the Genealogical Department,
of course, and all those other fellows&mdash;The
Bee-Keeper, and The Bishop
Afloat, and all the rest of 'em, I read The
Librarian <i>frequently</i>."</p>

<p>I blushed slightly.</p>

<p>"And I wish," continued my host, "that
you would treat my collection seriously."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gooch," I promised, "I will be as
solemn as&mdash;as&mdash;oh, as your brother's
annual reports. I can say no more than
that."</p>

<p>And we shook hands on it.
